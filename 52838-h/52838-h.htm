<p>Geology is the science of the Earth&mdash;the study of
the forces, processes, and past life that not only shape our
land but influence our daily lives and our Nation&rsquo;s welfare.
This booklet, prepared by two members of the U.S.
Geological Survey, discusses how geologic phenomena are
responsible for the magnificent scenery of the Teton region.</p>
<p>Recognition of the complex geologic history of our
Earth is vital to the enjoyment and appreciation of beautiful
landscapes and other natural wonders, to the planning
of our cities and highway systems, to the wise use of our
water supplies, to the study of earthquake and landslide
areas, to the never-ending search for new mineral deposits,
and to the conservation and development of our known
natural resources. Who can say, in the long run, which of
the many uses of this knowledge is the most compelling
reason to seek an understanding of the Earth?</p>

<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small">THE STORY BEGINS</span></h2>
<p>The Teton Range is one of the most magnificent
mountain ranges on the North American Continent. Others
are longer, wider, and higher, but few can rival the breath-taking
alpine grandeur of the eastern front of the Tetons.
Ridge after jagged ridge of naked rock soar upward into
the western sky, culminating in the towering cluster of
peaks to which the early French voyageurs gave the name
&ldquo;<i>les Trois Tetons</i>&rdquo; (the three breasts). The range hangs
like a great stone wave poised to break across the valley at
its base. To the south and east are lesser mountains, interesting
and scenic but lacking the magic appeal of the
Tetons.</p>
<p>This is a range of many moods and colors: stark and
austere in morning sun, but gold and purple and black in
the softly lengthening shadows of afternoon; somber and
foreboding when the peaks wrap themselves in the tattered
clouds of an approaching storm, but tranquil and ethereal
blue and silver beneath a full moon.</p>
<p>These great peaks and much of the floor of the valley
to the east, <i>Jackson Hole</i> (a <i>hole</i> was the term used by pioneer
explorers and mountain men to describe any open valley
encircled by mountains), lie within Grand Teton National
Park, protected and preserved for the enjoyment of
present and future generations. Each year more than 3
million visitors come to the park. Many pause briefly and
pass on. Others stay to explore its trails, fish its streams,
study the plants and wildlife that abound within its borders,
or to savor the colorful human history of this area.</p>
<p>Most visitors, whatever their interests and activities,
are probably first attracted to the park by its unsurpassed
mountain scenery. The jagged panorama of the Tetons is
the backdrop to which they may turn again and again, asking
questions, seeking answers. How did the mountains
form? How long have they towered into the clouds, washed
by rain, riven by frost, swept by wind and snow? What
enormous forces brought them forth and raised them skyward?
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
What stories are chronicled in their rocks, what
epics chiseled in the craggy visage of this mountain landscape?
Why are the Tetons different from other mountains?</p>
<h3 id="c3">First questions, brief answers</h3>
<p><i>How did the Tetons and Jackson Hole form?</i> They
are both tilted blocks of the earth&rsquo;s crust that behaved like
two adjoining giant trapdoors hinged so that they would
swing in opposite directions. The block on the west, which
forms the Teton Range, was hinged along the Idaho-Wyoming
State line; the eastern edge was uplifted along a fault
(a fracture along which displacement has occurred). This
is why the highest peaks and steepest faces are near the east
margin of the range. The hinge line of the eastern block,
which forms Jackson Hole, was in the highlands to the east.
The western edge of the block is downdropped along the
fault at the base of the Teton Range. As a consequence, the
floor of Jackson Hole tilts westward toward the Tetons (see
cross section inside back cover).</p>
<p><i>When did the Tetons and Jackson Hole develop the
spectacular scenery we see today?</i> The Tetons are the
youngest of all the mountain ranges in the Rocky Mountain
chain. Most other mountains in the region are at least 50
million years old but the Tetons are less than 10 million
and are still rising. Jackson Hole is of the same age and is
still sinking. The Teton landscape is the product of many
earth processes, the most recent of which is cutting by
water and ice. Within the last 15,000 years, ice sculpturing
of peaks and canyons and impounding of glacial lakes have
added finishing touches to the scenic beauty.</p>
<p><i>Why did the Tetons rise and Jackson Hole sink?</i> For
thousands of years men have wondered about the origin of
mountains and their speculations have filled many books.
Two of the more popular theories are: (1) continental drift
(such as South America moving away from Africa), with
the upper lighter layer of the earth&rsquo;s crust moving over the
lower denser layer and wrinkling along belts of weakness;
and (2) convection currents within the earth, caused by
heat transfer, resulting in linear zones of wrinkling, uplift,
and collapse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>These concepts were developed to explain the origin of
mountainous areas hundreds or thousands of miles long but
they do not answer directly the question of why the Tetons
rose and Jackson Hole sank. As is discussed in the chapter
on mountains, it is probable that semifluid rock far below
the surface of Jackson Hole flowed north into the Yellowstone
Volcanic Plateau-Absaroka Range volcanic area, perhaps
taking the place of the enormous amount of ash and
lava blown out of volcanoes during the last 50 million
years. The origin of the line of weakness that marks the
Teton fault along the east face of the Teton Range may go
back to some unknown inequality in the earth&rsquo;s composition
several billion years ago. Why it suddenly became active
late in the earth&rsquo;s history is an unanswered question.</p>
<p>The ultimate source of heat and energy that caused the
mountains and basins to form probably is disintegration of
radioactive materials deep within the earth. The Tetons are
a spectacular demonstration that the enormous energy
necessary to create mountains is not declining, even though
our planet is several billion years old.</p>
<h3 id="c4">An extraordinary story</h3>
<p>Visitors whose curiosity is whetted by this unusual and
varied panorama are not satisfied with only a few questions
and answers. They sense that here for the asking is an
extraordinary <i>geologic</i> (<i>geo</i>&mdash;earth; <i>logic</i>&mdash;science) story.
With a little direction, many subtle features become evident&mdash;features
that otherwise might escape notice. Here, for
example, is a valley with an odd U-shape. There is a sheer
face crisscrossed with light- and dark-colored rocks. On the
valley floor is a tuft of pine trees that seem to be confined
to one particular kind of rock. On the rolling hills is a layer
of peculiar white soil&mdash;the only soil in which coyote
dens are common. All these are geologically controlled
phenomena. In short, with a bit of initial guidance, the
viewer gains an ability to observe and to understand so
much that the panorama takes on new depth, vividness, and
excitement. It changes from a flat, two-dimensional picture
to a colorful multi-dimensional exhibit of the earth&rsquo;s
history.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c5">An astronaut&rsquo;s view</h3>
<p>The Tetons are a short, narrow, and high mountain
range, distinctive in the midst of the great chain of the
Rocky Mountains, the backbone of western North America.
<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows how the Tetons and their surroundings
might appear if you viewed them from a satellite at an altitude
of perhaps a hundred miles. The U.&nbsp;S. Geological Survey
topographic map of Grand Teton National Park shows
the names of many features not indicated on <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a> or on
the <a href="#fig62">geologic map</a> inside the back cover. The Teton Range is
a rectangular mountain block about 40 miles long and 10-15
miles wide. It is flanked on the east and west by flat-floored
valleys. Jackson Hole is the eastern one and Teton
Basin (called Pierre&rsquo;s Hole by the early trappers) is the
western.</p>
<p>The Teton Range is not symmetrical. The highest
peaks lie near the eastern edge of the mountain block,
rather than along its center, as is true in conventional
mountains, and the western slopes are broad and gentle in
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
contrast to the precipitous eastern slopes. The northern end
of the range disappears under enormous lava flows that
form the Yellowstone Volcanic Plateau. Even from this
altitude the outlines of some of these flows can be seen.</p>
<p>On the south the Teton Range abuts almost at right
angles against a northwest-trending area of lower and less
rugged mountains (the Snake River, Wyoming, and Hoback
Ranges). These mountains appear altogether different
from the Tetons. They consist of a series of long parallel
ridges cut or separated by valleys and canyons. This pattern
is characteristic of mountains composed of crumpled,
steeply tilted rock layers&mdash;erosion wears away the softer
layers, leaving the harder ones standing as ridges.</p>
<p>On the east and northeast, Jackson Hole is bounded by
the Gros Ventre and Washakie Ranges, which are composed
chiefly of folded hard and soft sedimentary rocks. In contrast,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
between these mountains and the deepest part of Jackson
Hole to the west, thick layers of soft nearly flat-lying
sedimentary rocks have been sculptured by streams and ice
into randomly oriented knife-edge ridges and rolling hills
separated by broad valleys. The hills east of the park are
called the Mount Leidy Highlands and those northeast are
the Pinyon Peak Highlands.</p>
<h3 id="c6">A pilot&rsquo;s view</h3>
<p>If you descend from 100 miles to about 5 miles above
the Teton region, the asymmetry of the range, the extraordinary
variety of landscapes, and the vivid colors of
rocks become more pronounced.</p>
<p><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> shows a panorama of the Teton Range and
Jackson Hole from a vantage point over the Pinyon Peak
Highlands. The rough steep slopes and jagged ridges along
the east front of the range contrast with smoother slopes
and more rounded ridges on the western side. Nestled at
the foot of the mountains and extending out onto the floor
of Jackson Hole are tree-rimmed sparkling lakes of many
sizes and shapes. Still others lie in steep-sided rocky
amphitheaters near the mountain crests.</p>
<p>One of the most colorful flight routes into Jackson
Hole is from the east, along the north flank of the Gros
Ventre Mountains. For 40 miles this mountain range is
bounded by broad parallel stripes of bright-red, pink, purple,
gray, and brown rocks. Some crop out as cliffs or
ridges, and others are <i>badlands</i> (bare unvegetated hills and
valleys with steep slopes and abundant dry stream channels).
In places the soft beds have broken loose and flowed
down slopes like giant varicolored masses of taffy. These
are mudflows and landslides. The colorful rocks are
bounded on the south by gray and yellow tilted layers forming
snowcapped peaks of the Gros Ventre Mountains.</p>
<p>These landscapes are the product of many natural
forces acting on a variety of rock types during long or short
intervals of geologic time. Each group of rocks records a
chapter in the geologic story of the region. Other chapters
can be read from the tilting, folding, and breaking of the
rocks. The latest episodes are written on the face of the
land itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h3 id="c7">A motorist&rsquo;s view</h3>
<p>Most park visitors first see the Teton peaks from the
highway. Whether they drive in from the south, east, or
north, there is one point on the route at which a spectacular
panorama of the Tetons and Jackson Hole suddenly appears.
Part of the thrill of these three views is that they are
so unexpected and so different. The geologic history is
responsible for these differences.</p>
<h4 id="c8"><i>View north.</i>&mdash;</h4>
<p>Throughout the first 4 miles north of
the town of Jackson, the view of the Tetons from U.&nbsp;S.
26-89 is blocked by East Gros Ventre Butte. At the north
end of the butte, the highway climbs onto a flat upland
at the south boundary of Grand Teton National Park.
Without any advance warning, the motorist sees the whole
east front of the Teton Range rising steeply from the amazingly
flat floor of Jackson Hole.</p>
<p>From the park boundary turnout no lakes or rivers are
visible to the north but the nearest line of trees in the direction
of the highest Teton peaks marks the approximate position
of the Gros Ventre River. The elevation of this river is
surprising, for the route has just come up a 150-foot hill,
out of the flat valley of a much smaller stream, yet here at
eye-level is a major river perched on an upland plain. The
reason for these strange relations is that the hill is a fault
scarp (see <a href="#fig16A">fig. 16A</a> for a diagram) and the valley in which
the town of Jackson is located was dropped 150 feet or
more in the last 15,000 years.</p>
<p>On the skyline directly west of the turnout are horizontal
and inclined layers of rocks. These once extended
over the tops of the highest peaks but were worn away from
some parts as the mountains rose. All along the range, trees
grow only up to <i>treeline</i> (also called <i>timberline</i>&mdash;a general
elevation above which trees do not grow) which here is
about 10,500 feet above the sea. To the southeast and east,
beyond the sage-covered floor of Jackson Hole, are rolling
partly forested slopes marking the west end of the Gros
Ventre Mountains. They do not look at all like the Tetons
because they were formed in a very different manner. The
Gros Ventres are folded mountains that have foothills; the
Tetons are faulted mountains that do not.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Three steepsided hills called <i>buttes</i> rise out of the flat
floor of Jackson Hole. They are tilted and faulted masses
of hard, layered rock that have been shaped by southward-moving
glaciers. Six miles north of the boundary turnout
is Blacktail Butte, on the flanks of which are west-dipping
white beds. Southwest of the turnout is East Gros Ventre
Butte, composed largely of layered rocks that are exposed
along the road from Jackson almost to the turnout. These
are capped by very young lava that forms the brown cliff
overlooking the highway at the north end of the butte. To
the southwest is West Gros Ventre Butte, composed of similar
rocks.</p>
<h4 id="c9"><i>View west.</i>&mdash;</h4>
<p>The motorist traveling west along U.&nbsp;S.
26-287 is treated to two magnificent views of the Teton
Range. The first is 8 miles and the second 13 miles west
of Togwotee Pass. At these vantage points, between 20
and 30 miles from the mountains, the great peaks seem half
suspended between earth and sky&mdash;too close, almost, to
believe, but too distant to comprehend.</p>
<p>Only from closer range can the motorist begin to appreciate
the size and steepness of the mountains and to discern
the details of their architecture. The many roads on
the floor of Jackson Hole furnish ever-changing vistas, and
signs provided by the National Park Service at numerous
turnouts and scenic overlooks help the visitor to identify
quickly the major peaks and canyons and the principal features
of the valley floor. Of all these roadside vantage
points, the top of Signal Mountain, an isolated hill rising
nearly 1,000 feet out of the east margin of Jackson Lake,
probably offers the best overall perspective (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). To the
west, across the shimmering blue waters of Jackson Lake,
the whole long parade of rugged peaks stretches from the
north horizon to the south, many of the higher ones wearing
the tattered remnants of winter snow. From here, only 8
miles away, the towering pinnacles, saw-toothed ridges, and
deep U-shaped canyons are clearly visible.</p>
<p>Unlike most other great mountain ranges, the Tetons rise
steeply from the flat valley floor in a straight unbroken
line. The high central peaks tower more than a mile above
the valley, but northward and southward the peaks diminish
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
in height and lose their jagged character, gradually giving
way to lower ridges and rounded hills. Some of the details
of the mountain rock can be seen&mdash;gnarled gray rocks of
the high peaks threaded by a fine white lacework of dikes,
the dark band that cleaves through Mount Moran from base
to summit, and the light brown and gray layers on the
northern and southern parts of the range.</p>
<p>At first glance the floor of Jackson Hole south of Signal
Mountain seems flat, smooth, and featureless, except
for the Snake River that cuts diagonally across it. Nevertheless,
even the flats show a variety of land forms. The
broad sage-covered areas, low isolated hills, and hummocky
tree-studded ridges that form the foreground are all parts
of the Teton landscape, and give us clues to the natural processes
that shaped it. A critical look to the south discloses
more strange things. We take for granted the fact that the
sides of normal valleys slope inward toward a central major
stream. South of Signal Mountain, however, the visitor
can see that the Snake River Valley does not fit this description.
The broad flat west of the river should slope east but
it does not. Instead, it has been tilted westward by downward
movement along the Teton fault at the base of the
mountains.</p>
<h4 id="c10"><i>View south.</i>&mdash;</h4>
<p>About a million motorists drive south
from Yellowstone to Grand Teton National Park each year.
As they wind along the crooked highway on the west brink
of Lewis River Canyon (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>), the view south is everywhere
blocked by dense forest. Then, abruptly the road
leaves the canyon, straightens out, and one can look south
down a 3-mile sloping avenue cut through the trees. There,
20 to 30 miles away, framed by the roadway, are the snow-capped
Tetons, with Jackson Lake, luminous in reflected
light, nestled against the east face. This is one of the loveliest
and most unusual views of the mountains that is available
to the motorist, partly because he is 800 feet above the
level of Jackson Lake and partly because this is the only
place on a main highway where he can see clearly the third
dimension (width) of the Tetons. The high peaks are on
the east edge; they rise 7,000 feet above the lake but other
peaks and precipitous ridges, progressively diminishing in
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
height, extend on to the west for a dozen miles (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>).
Giant, relatively young lava flows, into which the Lewis
River Canyon was cut, poured southward all the way to the
shore of Jackson Lake and buried the north end of the Teton
Range (figs. <a href="#fig13">13</a> and <a href="#fig53">53</a>). South of Yellowstone Park these
flows were later tilted and broken by the dropping of Jackson
Hole and the rise of the mountains.</p>
<h3 id="c11">A mountaineer&rsquo;s view</h3>
<p>As in many pursuits in life, the greatest rewards of a
visit to the Tetons come to those who expend a real effort to
earn them. Only by leaving the teeming valley and going
up into the mountains to hike the trails and climb the peaks
can the visitor come to know the Tetons in all their moods
and changes and view close at hand the details of this
magnificent mountain edifice.</p>
<p>Even a short hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration
Point affords an opportunity for a more intimate view
of the mountains. Along the trail the hiker can examine
outcrops of sugary white granite, glittering mica-studded
dikes, and dark intricately layered rocks. Nearby are
great piles of broken fragments that have fallen from
the cliffs above, and the visitor can begin to appreciate how
vulnerable are the towering crags to the relentless onslaught
of frost and snow. The roar of the foaming stream and the
thunder of the falls are constant reminders of the patient
work of running water in wearing away the &ldquo;everlasting
hills.&rdquo; Running his hand across one of the smoothly polished
rock faces below Inspiration Point, the hiker gains an
unforgettable concept of the power of glacial ice and its
importance in shaping this majestic landscape. Looking
back across Jenny Lake at the encircling ridge of glacial
debris, he can easily comprehend the size of the ancient
glacier that once flowed down Cascade Canyon and
emerged onto the floor of Jackson Hole.</p>
<p>The more ambitious hiker or mountaineer can seek out
the inner recesses of the range and explore other facets of
its geology. He can visit the jewel-like mountain lakes&mdash;Solitude,
Holly, and Amphitheater are just a few&mdash;cradled
in high remote basins left by the Ice Age glaciers. He can
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
get a closeup view of the Teton Glacier above Amphitheater
Lake, or explore the Schoolroom Glacier, the tiny ice body
below Hurricane Pass. He may follow the trail into Garnet
Canyon to see the crystals from which the canyon takes its
name and to examine the soaring ribbonlike black dike near
the end of the trail. In Alaska Basin he can study the gently
tilted layers of sandstone, limestone, and shale that once
blanketed the entire Teton Range and can search for the
fossils that help determine their age and decipher their history.
From Hurricane Pass he can see how these even layers
of sedimentary rock have been broken and displaced
and how the older harder rocks that form the highest Teton
peaks have been raised far above them along the Buck
Mountain fault.</p>
<p>Of all those who explore the high country, it is the
mountaineer who has perhaps the greatest opportunity to
appreciate its geologic story. Indeed, the success of his
climb and his very life may depend on an intuitive grasp of
the mountain geology and the processes that shaped the
peaks. He observes the most intimate details&mdash;the inclination
of the joints and fractures, which gullies are swept by
falling rocks, which projecting knobs are firm, and which
cracks will safely take a piton. To many climbers the ascent
of a peak is a challenge to technical competence, endurance,
and courage, but to those endowed with curiosity and a
sharp eye it can be much more. As he stands shoulder to
shoulder with the clouds on some windswept peak, such as
the Grand Teton, with the awesome panorama dropping
away on all sides, he can hardly avoid asking how this came
to be. What does the mountaineer see that inspires this
curiosity? From the very first glance, it is apparent that
the scenes to the north, south, east, and west are startlingly
different.</p>
<p>Looking west from the rough, narrow, weather-ravaged
granite summit of the Grand Teton, one sees far below
him the layered gray cliffs of <i>marine sedimentary rocks</i>
(solidified sediment originally deposited in a shallow arm
of the ocean) overlapping the granite and dipping gently
west, finally disappearing under the checkerboard farmland
of Teton Basin. Still farther west are the rolling timbered
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
slopes of the Big Hole Range in Idaho. A glance at
the foreground, 3,000 feet below, shows some unusual relations
of the streams to the mountains. The watershed divide
of the Teton Range is not marked by the highest peaks as
one would expect. Streams in Cascade Canyon and in other
canyons to the north and south begin west of the peaks, bend
around them, then flow eastward in deep narrow gorges cut
through the highest part of the range, and emerge onto the
flat floor of Jackson Hole.</p>
<p>In the view north along the crest of the Teton Range,
the asymmetry of the mountains is most apparent. The
steep east face culminating in the highest peaks contrasts
with the lower more gentle west flank of the uplift. From
the Grand Teton it is not possible to see the actual place
where the mountains disappear under the lavas of Yellowstone
Park, but the heavily timbered broad gentle surface of
the lava plain is visible beyond the peaks and extends
across the entire north panorama. Still farther north, 75 to
100 miles away, rise the snowcapped peaks (from northwest
to northeast) of the Madison, Gallatin, and Beartooth
Mountains.</p>
<p>The view east presents the greatest contrasts in the
shortest distances&mdash;the flat floor of Jackson Hole is 3 miles
away and 7,000 feet below the top of the Grand Teton.
Along the junction of the mountains and valley floor are
blue glacial lakes strung out like irregular beads in a necklace.
They are conspicuously rimmed by black-appearing
margins of pine trees that grow only on the surrounding
glacial moraines. Beyond these are the broad treeless
boulder-strewn plains of Jackson Hole. Fifty miles to the
east and northeast, on the horizon beyond the rolling hills
of the Pinyon Peak Highlands, are the horizontally layered
volcanic rocks of the Absaroka Range. Southeast is the
colorful red, purple, green, and gray Gros Ventre River
Valley, with the fresh giant scar of the Lower Gros Ventre
Slide near its mouth. Bounding the south side of this valley
are the peaks of the Gros Ventre Mountains, whose tilted
slabby gray cliff-forming layers resemble (and are the
same as) those on the west flank of the Teton Range. Seventy
miles away, in the southeast distance, beyond the Gros
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Ventre Mountains are the shining snowcapped peaks of the
Wind River Range, the highest peak of which (Gannett
Peak) is about 20 feet higher than the Grand Teton.</p>
<p>Conspicuous on the eastern and southeastern skyline
are high-level (11,000-12,000 feet) flat-topped surfaces
on both the Wind River and Absaroka Ranges. These are
remnants that mark the upper limit of sedimentary fill of
the basins adjacent to the mountains. A plain once connected
these surfaces and extended westward at least as far
as the conspicuous flat on the mountain south of Lower
Gros Ventre Slide. It is difficult to imagine the amount of
rock that has been washed away from between these remnants
in comparatively recent geologic time, during and
after the rise of the Teton Range.</p>
<p>From this vantage point the mountaineer also gets a
concept of the magnitude of the first and largest glaciers
that scoured the landscape. Ice flowed southwestward in an
essentially unbroken stream from the Beartooth Mountains,
100 miles away, westward from the Absaroka Range, and
northwestward from the Wind River Range (<a href="#fig57">fig. 57</a>). Ice
lapped up to treeline on the Teton Range and extended
across Jackson Hole nearly to the top of the Lower Gros
Ventre Slide. The Pinyon Peak and Mount Leidy Highlands
were almost buried. All these glaciers came together
in Jackson Hole and flowed south within the ever-narrowing
Snake River Valley.</p>
<p>The view south presents a great variety of contrasts.
Conspicuous, as in the view north, is the asymmetry of the
range. South of the high peaks of crystalline rocks, gray
layered cliffs of limestone extend in places all the way to
the steep east face of the Teton Range where they are
abruptly cut off by the great Teton fault.</p>
<p>The flat treeless floor of Jackson Hole narrows southward.
Rising out of the middle are the previously described
steepsided ice-scoured rocky buttes. Beginning near the
town of Jackson, part of which is visible, and extending as
far south as the eye can see are row upon row of sharp
ridges and snowcapped peaks that converge at various
angles. These are the Hoback, Wyoming, Salt River, and
Snake River Ranges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br /><span class="small">CARVING THE RUGGED PEAKS</span></h2>
<p>The rugged grandeur of the Tetons is a product of
four geologic factors: the tough hard rocks in the core, the
amount of vertical uplift, the recency of the mountain-making
movement, and the dynamic forces of destruction.
Many other mountains in Wyoming have just as hard rocks
in their cores and an equally great amount of vertical uplift,
but they rose 50 to 60 million years ago and have been
worn down by erosion from that time on. The Tetons, on
the other hand, are the youngest range in Wyoming, less
than 10 million years old, and have not had time to be so
deeply eroded.</p>
<h3 id="c13">Steep mountain slopes&mdash;the perpetual battleground</h3>
<p>Any steep slope or cliff is especially vulnerable to
nature&rsquo;s methods of destruction. In the Tetons we see the
never-ending struggle between two conflicting factors. The
first is the extreme toughness of the rocks and their consequent
resistance to erosion. The second is the presence of
efficient transporting agencies that move out and away
from the mountains all rock debris that might otherwise
bury the lower slopes.</p>
<p>The rocks making up most of the Teton Range are
among the hardest, toughest, and least porous known.
Therefore, they resist mechanical disintegration by temperature
changes, ice, and water. They consist predominantly
of minerals that are subject to very little chemical decay in
the cold climate of the Tetons.</p>
<p>Absence of weak layers prevents breaking of the tough
rock masses under their own weight. All these conditions,
then, are favorable for preservation of steep walls and high
rock pinnacles. Nevertheless, they do break down. Great
piles of broken rock <i>(talus)</i> that festoon the slopes of all
the higher peaks bear witness to the unrelenting assault by
the process of erosion upon the mountain citadels (figs. <a href="#fig4">4</a>
and <a href="#fig31">31</a>).</p>
<h3 id="c14">Rock disintegration and gravitational movement</h3>
<p>A great variation in both daily and annual temperatures
results in minute amounts of contraction and expansion
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
of rock particles. Repeated changes in volume produce
stress and strain. Although the rocks in the Tetons are very
dense, they eventually yield; a crack forms. Water which
seeps in along this surface of weakness freezes, either overnight
or during long cold spells, and expands, thereby prying
a slab of rock away from the mountain wall. Repeated
<i>frost wedging</i>, as the process is called, results eventually
in tipping the slab so that it falls.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="488" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 4. <i>Talus at the foot of the jagged frost-riven peaks around Ice Floe
Lake in the south fork of Cascade Canyon. Photo by Philip Hyde.</i></p>
</div>
<p>What happens to the rock slab? It may fall and roll
several hundred or thousand feet, depending on the steepness
of the mountain surface. Pieces are broken off as it
encounters obstacles. All the fragments find their way to a
valley floor or slope, where they momentarily come to rest.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Thus, rock debris is moved significant and easily observed
distances by gravity.</p>
<p>None of this debris is stationary. If it is mixed with
snow or saturated with water, the whole mass may slowly
flow in the same manner as a glacier. These are called
<i>rock glaciers</i>; some can be seen on the south side of
Granite Canyon and one, nearly a mile long, is in the valley
north of Eagles Rest Peak.</p>
<p>The countless snow avalanches that thunder down the
mountain flanks after heavy winter snowfalls play their
part, too, in gravitational transport. Loose rocks and debris
are incorporated with the moving snow and borne down the
mountainsides to the talus piles below. Trees, bushes, and
soil are swept from the sites of the slides, leaving conspicuous
scars down the slopes and exposing new rock surfaces
to the attack of water and frost. Battered, broken, and uprooted
trees along many of the canyon trails bear silent witness
to the awesome power of snowslides.</p>
<p>These are some of the methods used by Nature in making
debris and then, by means of gravity, clearing it from
the mountain slopes. There are other ways, too. A weak
layer of rock (usually one with a lot of clay in it), parallel
to and underlying a mountain slope, may occur between
two hard layers. An extended rainy spell may result in
saturation of the weak zone so that it is well lubricated;
then an earthquake or perhaps merely the weight of the
overlying rock sends the now unstable mass cascading down
the slope to the valley below. The famous Lower Gros Ventre
Slide (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>) was formed in this way on June 23, 1925.</p>
<h3 id="c15">Running water cuts and carries</h3>
<p>Running water is another effective agent that transports
rock debris and has helped dissect the Teton Range.
The damage a broken water main can wreak on a roadbed
is well known, as is the havoc of destructive floods. The
spring floods of streams in the Tetons, swollen by melting
snow and ice (annual precipitation, mostly snow, in the
high parts would average a layer of water 5 feet thick),
move some rock debris onto the adjoining floor of Jackson
Hole.</p>

one-half mile wide. It dammed the Gros Ventre River in the foreground,
impounding a lake about 200 feet deep and 5 miles long. Gros Ventre
Mountains are in the distance. Photo by P. E. Millward.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Now and then the range is deluged by summer cloudbursts.
Water funnels down the maze of gullies on the
mountainsides, quickly gathering volume and power, and
plunges on to the talus slopes below, as if from gigantic
hoses. The sudden onslaught of these torrents of water on
the saturated unstable talus may trigger enormous rock and
mudflows that carry vast quantities of material down into
the canyons. During the summer of 1941 more than 100 of
these flows occurred in the park.</p>
<p>Wherever water moves, it carries rock fragments varying
in size from boulders to sand grains and on down to
minute clay particles. <i>Erosion</i> (wearing away) by streams
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
is conspicuous wherever the water is muddy, as it always is
each spring in the Snake, Buffalo Fork, and Gros Ventre
Rivers. Clear mountain streams likewise can erode. Although
the volume of material moved and the amount of
downcutting of the stream bottom may not seem great in a
single stream, the cumulative effect of many streams in an
area, year after year and century after century, is enormous.
Streams not only transport rocks brought to them by
gravitational movement but also continually widen and
deepen their valleys, thereby increasing the volume of
transported debris.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of streams as transporting agents in
the Tetons is enhanced by steep <i>gradients</i> (slopes); these
increase water velocity which in turn expands the capability
of the streams to carry larger and larger rock fragments.</p>
<h3 id="c16">Glaciers scour and transport</h3>
<p>Mountain landscapes shaped by frost action, gravitational
transport, and stream erosion alone generally have
rounded summits, smooth slopes, and V-shaped valleys. The
jagged ridges, sharply pointed peaks, and deep U-shaped
valleys of the Tetons show that glaciers have played an
important role in their sculpture. The small present-day
glaciers still cradled in shaded recesses among the higher
peaks (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) are but miniature replicas of great ice
streams that occupied the region during the Ice Age. Evidence
both here and in other parts of the world confirms
that glaciers were once far more extensive than they are
today.</p>
<p>Glaciers form wherever more snow accumulates during
the winter than is melted during the summer. Gradually
the piles of snow solidify to form ice, which begins to flow
under its own weight. Rocks that have fallen from the surrounding
ridges or have been picked up from the underlying
bedrock are incorporated in the moving ice mass and
carried along. The ability of ice to transport huge volumes
of rock is easily observed even in the small present-day
glaciers in the Tetons, all of which carry abundant rock
fragments both on and within the ice.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Recent measurements show that the ice in the present
Teton Glacier (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) moves nearly 30 feet per year. The
ancient glaciers, which were much wider and deeper, may
have moved as much as several hundred feet a year, like
some of the large glaciers in Alaska.</p>
<p>As the glacier moves down a valley, it scours the valley
bottom and walls. The efficiency of ice in this process
is greatly increased by the presence of rock fragments
which act as abrasives. The valley bottom is plowed, quarried,
and swept clean of soil and loose rocks. Fragments of
many sizes and shapes are dragged along the bottom of the
moving ice and the hard ones scratch long parallel grooves
in the underlying tough bedrock (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>). Such grooves
(<i>glacial striae</i>) record the direction of ice movement.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of glaciers in cutting a U-shaped
valley is particularly striking in Glacier Gulch and Cascade
Canyon (figs. <a href="#fig2">2</a> and <a href="#fig8">8</a>).</p>
<p>The rock-walled amphitheater at the head of a glaciated
valley is called a <i>cirque</i> (a good example is at the upper
edge of the Teton Glacier, <a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>). The steep cirque walls
develop by frost action and by quarrying and abrasive action
of the glacier ice where it is near its maximum thickness.
Commonly the glacier scoops out a shallow basin in
the floor of the cirque. Amphitheater Lake, Lake Solitude,
Holly Lake, and many of the other small lakes high in the
Teton Range are located in such basins.</p>
<p>The sharp peaks and the jagged knife-edge ridges so
characteristic of the Tetons are divides left between cirques
and valleys carved by the ancient glaciers.</p>
<h3 id="c17">Effects on Jackson Hole</h3>
<p>Rock debris is carried toward the end of the glacier or
along the margins where it is released as the ice melts. The
semicircular ridge of rock fragments that marks the downhill
margin of the glacier is called a <i>terminal moraine</i>;
that along the sides is a <i>lateral moraine</i> (figs. <a href="#fig9">9</a> and <a href="#fig10">10</a>).
These are formed by the slow accumulation of material in
the same manner as that at the end of a conveyor belt. They
are not built by material pushed up ahead of the ice as if by
a bulldozer. Large boulders carried by ice are called
<i>erratics</i>; many of these are scattered on the floor of Jackson
Hole and on the flanks of the surrounding mountains
(<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>

<p class="pcap">Figure 7. <i>Rock surface polished and grooved by ice on the floor of Glacier Gulch.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Great volumes of water pour from melting ice near the
lower end of a glacier. These streams, heavily laden with
rock flour produced by the grinding action of the glacier
and with debris liberated from the melting ice, cut channels
through the terminal moraine and spread a broad apron of
gravel, sand, and silt down-valley from the glacier terminus
(end). Material deposited by streams issuing from a glacier
is called <i>outwash</i>; the sheet of outwash in front of the
glacier is called an <i>outwash plain</i>. If the terminus is retreating,
masses of old stagnant ice commonly are buried
beneath the outwash; when these melt, the space they once
occupied becomes a deep circular or irregular depression
called a <i>kettle</i> (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>); many of these now contain small
lakes or swamps.</p>
<p>As a glacier retreats, it may build a series of terminal
moraines, marking pauses in the recession of the ice front.
Streams issuing from the ice behind each new terminal
moraine are incised more and more deeply into the older
moraines and their outwash plains. Thus, new and younger
layers of bouldery debris are spread at successively lower
and lower levels. These surfaces are called <i>outwash
terraces</i>.</p>

eastward from the south entrance to the park can see clearly
glacial scour lines that superficially resemble a series of
terraces on the bare lower slopes of the Gros Ventre Mountains.
Southward-moving ice cut these features in hard
rocks. Elsewhere around the margins of Jackson Hole,
especially where the rocks are soft, evidence that the landscape
was shaped by ice has been partly or completely obliterated
by later events. Rising 1,000 feet above the floor of
Jackson Hole are several steepsided buttes (figs. <a href="#fig13">13</a> and
<a href="#fig55">55</a>) described previously, that represent &ldquo;islands&rdquo; of hard
rock overridden and abraded by the ice. After the ice melted,

debris.</p>

<p>Mountains appear ageless, but as with people, they
pass through the stages of birth, youth, maturity, and old
age, and eventually disappear. The Tetons are youthful
and steep and are, therefore, extremely vulnerable to destructive
processes that are constantly sculpturing the
rugged features and carrying away the debris. The mountains
are being destroyed. Although the processes of destruction
may seem slow to us, we know they have been operating
for millions of years&mdash;so why have the mountains not
been leveled? How did they form in the first place?</p>
<h3 id="c19">Kinds of mountains</h3>
<p>There are many kinds of mountains. Some are piles of
lava and debris erupted from a volcano. Others are formed
by the bowing up of the earth&rsquo;s crust in the shape of a giant
dome or elongated arch. Still others are remnants of accumulated
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
sedimentary rocks that once filled a basin between
preexisting mountains and which are now partially
worn away. An example of this type is the Absaroka Range
40 miles northeast of the Tetons (figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a> and <a href="#fig52">52</a>).</p>
<p>The Tetons are a still different kind&mdash;a <i>fault block
mountain range</i> carved from a segment of the earth&rsquo;s crust
that has been uplifted along a fault. The <i>Teton fault</i> is
approximately at the break in slope where the eastern foot
of the range joins the flats at the west edge of Jackson Hole
(see <a href="#fig62">map</a> inside back cover), but in most places is concealed
beneath glacial deposits and debris shed from the
adjacent steep slopes. The shape of the range and its relation
to Jackson Hole have already been described. Clues as
to the presence of the fault are: (1) the straight and deep
east face of the Teton Range, (2) absence of foothills, (3)
asymmetry of the range (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>), and (4) small <i>fault
scarps</i> (cliffs or steep slopes formed by faulting) along
the mountain front (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>Recent geophysical surveys of Jackson Hole combined
with data from deep wells drilled in search of oil and gas
east of the park also yield valuable clues. By measuring
variations in the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field and in the pull of
gravity and by studying the speed of shock waves generated
by small dynamite explosions, Dr. John C. Behrendt of the
U.&nbsp;S. Geological Survey has determined the depth and tilt
of rock layers buried beneath the veneer of glacial debris
and stream-laid sand and gravel on the valley floor. This
information was used in constructing the geologic cross section
in the back of the booklet. The same rock layers that
cap the summit of Mount Moran (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>) are buried at
depths of nearly 24,000 feet beneath the nearby floor of
Jackson Hole but are cut off by the Teton fault at the west
edge of the valley. Thus the approximate amount of movement
along the fault here would be about 30,000 feet.</p>
<h3 id="c20">Anatomy of faults</h3>
<p>The preceding discussion shows that the Tetons are an
upfaulted mountain block. Why is this significant? The
extreme youth of the Teton fault, its large amount of displacement,
and the fact that the newly upfaulted angular
mountain block was subjected to intense glaciation are
among the prime factors responsible for the development of
the magnificent alpine scenery of the Teton Range. An understanding
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
of the anatomy of faults is, therefore, pertinent.</p>

<p>A fault is a plane or zone in the earth&rsquo;s crust along
which the rocks on one side have moved in relation to the
rocks on the other. There are various kinds of faults just as
there are various types of mountains. Three principal types
of faults are present in the Teton region: normal faults,
reverse faults, and thrust faults. A <i>normal fault</i> (<a href="#fig16A">fig. 16A</a>)
is a steeply <i>dipping</i> (steeply inclined) fault along
which rocks above the fault have moved <i>down</i> relative to
those beneath it. A <i>reverse fault</i> (<a href="#fig16B">fig. 16B</a>) is a steeply
inclined fault along which the rocks above the fault have
moved <i>up</i> relative to those below it. A <i>thrust fault</i> (<a href="#fig16C">fig. 16C</a>)
is a gently inclined fault along which the principal
movement has been more nearly horizontal than vertical.</p>
<p>Normal faults may be the result of tension or pulling
apart of the earth&rsquo;s crust or they may be caused by adjustment
of the rigid crust to the flow of semi-fluid material below.
The crust sags or collapses in areas from which the
subcrustal material has flowed and is bowed up and
stretched in areas where excess subcrustal material has
accumulated. In both areas the adjustments may result in
normal faults.</p>
<p>Reverse faults are generally caused by compression of
a rigid block of the crust, but some may also be due to lateral
flow of subcrustal material.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Thrust faults are commonly associated with tightly
bent or folded rocks. Many of them are apparently caused
by severe compression of part of the crust, but some are
thought to have formed at the base of slides of large rock
masses that moved from high areas into adjacent low areas
under the influence of gravity.</p>
<p>The Teton fault (see <a href="#pic2">cross section</a> inside back cover)
is a normal fault; the Buck Mountain fault, which lies west
of the main peaks of the Teton Range, is a reverse fault. No
thrust faults have been recognized in the Teton Range, but
the mountains south and southwest of the Tetons (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>)
display several enormous thrust faults along which masses
of rocks many miles in extent have moved tens of miles eastward
and northeastward.</p>
<h3 id="c21">Time and rate of uplift</h3>
<p>When did the Tetons rise?</p>
<p>A study of the youngest sedimentary rocks on the floor
of Jackson Hole shows that the Teton Range began to rise
rapidly and take its present shape less than 9 million years
ago. The towering peaks themselves are direct evidence that
the rate of uplift far exceeded the rate at which the rising
block was worn away by erosion. The mountains are still
rising, and comparatively rapidly, as is indicated by small
faults cutting the youngest deposits (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>).</p>
<p>How rapidly? Can the rate be measured?</p>
<p>We know that in less than 9 million years (and probably
in less than 7 million years) there has been 25,000 to
30,000 feet of displacement on the Teton fault. This is an
average of about 1 foot in 300-400 years. The movement
probably was not continuous but came as a series of jerks
accompanied by violent earthquakes. One fault on the floor
of Jackson Hole near the southern boundary of the park
moved 150 feet in the last 15,000 years, an average of 1
foot per 100 years.</p>
<p>In view of this evidence of recent crustal unrest, it is
not surprising that small earthquakes are frequent in the
Teton region. More violent ones can probably be expected
from time to time.</p>

<h3 id="c22">Why are mountains here?</h3>
<p>Why did the Tetons form where they are?</p>
<p>At the beginning of this booklet we discussed briefly
the two most common theories of origin of mountains: continental
drift and convection currents. The question of why
mountains are where they are and more specifically why
the Tetons are here remains a continuing scientific challenge
regardless of the wealth of data already accumulated
in our storehouse of knowledge.</p>
<p>The mobility of the earth&rsquo;s crust is an established fact.
Despite its apparent rigidity, laboratory experiments demonstrate
that rocks flow when subjected to extremely high
pressures and temperatures. If the stress exceeds the
strength at a given pressure and temperature, the rock
breaks. Flowing and fracturing are two of the ways by
which rocks adjust to the changing environments at various
levels in the earth&rsquo;s crust. These acquired characteristics,
some of which can be duplicated in the laboratory, are
guides by which we interpret the geologic history of rocks
that once were deep within the earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The site of the Teton block no doubt reflects hidden inequalities
at depth. We cannot see these, nor in this area
can we drill below the outer layer of the earth; nevertheless,
measurements of gravity and of the earth&rsquo;s magnetic
field clearly show that they exist.</p>
<p>We know that the Tetons rose at the time Jackson Hole
collapsed but the volume of the uplifted block is considerably
less than that of the downdropped block. This, then,
was not just a simple case in which all the subcrustal material
displaced by the sinking block was squeezed under
the rising block (the way a hydraulic jack works). What
happened to the rest of the material that once was under
Jackson Hole? It could not be compressed so it had to go
somewhere.</p>
<p>As you look northward from the top of the Grand Teton
or Mount Moran, or from the main highway at the north
edge of Grand Teton National Park, you see the great
smooth sweep of the volcanic plateau in Yellowstone National
Park. Farther off to the northeast are the strikingly
layered volcanic rocks of the Absaroka Range (<a href="#fig52">fig. 52</a>).
For these two areas, an estimate of the volume of volcanic
rock that reached the surface and flowed out, or was blown
out and spread far and wide by wind and water, is considerably
in excess of 10,000 cubic miles. On the other hand,
this volume is many times more than that displaced by the
sagging and downfaulting of Jackson Hole.</p>
<p>Where did the rest of the volcanic material come
from? Is it pertinent to our story? Teton Basin, on the west
side of the Teton Range, and the broad Snake River downwarp
farther to the northwest (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) are sufficiently large
to have furnished the remainder of the volcanic debris. As
it was blown out of vents in the Yellowstone-Absaroka area,
its place could have been taken deep underground by material
that moved laterally from below all three downdropped
areas. The movement may have been caused by
slow convection currents within the earth, or perhaps by
some other, as yet unknown, force. The sagging of the
earth&rsquo;s crust on both sides of the Teton Range as well as the
long-continued volcanism are certainly directly related to
the geologic history of the park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>In summary, we theorize as to how the Tetons rose and
Jackson Hole sank but are not sure why the range is located
at this particular place, why it trends north, why it rose so
high, or why this one, of all the mountain ranges surrounding
the Yellowstone-Absaroka volcanic area, had such a
unique history of uplift. These are problems to challenge
the minds of generations of earth scientists yet to come.</p>
<h3 id="c23">The restless land</h3>
<p>Among the greatest of the park&rsquo;s many attractions is
the solitude one can savor in the midst of magnificent scenery.
Only a short walk separates us from the highway,
torrents of cars, noise, and tension. Away from these,
everything seems restful.</p>
<p>Quiescent it may seem, yet the landscape is not static
but dynamic. This is one of the many exciting ideas that
geology has contributed to society. The concept of the
&ldquo;everlasting hills&rdquo; is a myth. All the features around us are
actually rather short-lived in terms of geologic time. The
discerning eye detects again and again the restlessness of
the land. We have discussed many bits of evidence that
show how the landscape and the earth&rsquo;s crust beneath it are
constantly being carved, pushed up, dropped down, folded,
tilted, and faulted.</p>
<p>The Teton landscape is a battleground, the scene of a
continuing unresolved struggle between the forces that deform
the earth&rsquo;s crust and raise the mountains and the slow
processes of erosion that strive to level the uplands, fill the
hollows, and reduce the landscape to an ultimate featureless
plain. The remainder of this booklet is devoted to tracing
the seesaw conflict between these inexorable antagonists
through more than 2.5 billion years as they shaped the present
landscape&mdash;and the battle still goes on.</p>
<p>Evidence of the struggle is all around us. Even though
to some observers it may detract from the restfulness of the
scene, perhaps it conveys to all of us a new appreciation of
the tremendous dynamic forces responsible for the magnificence
of the Teton Range.</p>
<p>The battle is indicated by the small faults that displace
both the land surface and young deposits at the east base of
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
Mount Teewinot, Rockchuck Peak (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>), and other
places along the foot of the Tetons.</p>
<p>Jackson Hole continues to drop and tilt. The gravel-covered
surfaces that originally sloped southward are now
tilted westward toward the mountains. The Snake River,
although the major stream, is not in the lowest part of Jackson
Hole; Fish Creek, a lesser tributary near the town of
Wilson, is 15 feet lower. For 10 miles this creek flows
southward parallel to the Snake River but with a gentler
gradient, thus permitting the two streams to join near the
south end of Jackson Hole. As tilting continues, the Snake
River west of Jackson tries to move westward but is prevented
from doing so by long flood-control levees built
south of the park.</p>
<p>Recent faults also break the valley floor between the
Gros Ventre River and the town of Jackson.</p>
<p>The ever-changing piles of rock debris that mantle the
slopes adjacent to the higher peaks, the creeping advance of
rock glaciers, the devastating snow avalanches, and the
thundering rockfalls are specific reminders that the land
surface is restless. Jackson Hole contains more landslides
and rock mudflows than almost any other part of the
Rocky Mountain region. They constantly plague road
builders (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>) and add to the cost of other types of
construction.</p>
<p>All of these examples of the relentless battle between
constructive and destructive processes modifying the Teton
landscape are but minor skirmishes. The bending and
breaking of rocks at the surface are small reflections of
enormous stresses and strains deep within the earth where
the major conflict is being waged. It is revealed every now
and then by a convulsion such as the 1959 earthquake in
and west of Yellowstone Park. Events of this type release
much more energy than all the nuclear devices thus far
exploded by man.</p>

<h2 id="c24"><br /><span class="small">ENORMOUS TIME AND DYNAMIC EARTH</span></h2>
<h3 id="c25">Framework of time</h3>
<p>One of geology&rsquo;s greatest philosophical contributions
has been the demonstration of the enormity of geologic
time. Astronomers deal with distances so great that they are
almost beyond understanding; nuclear physicists study objects
so small that we can hardly imagine them. Similarly,
the geologist is concerned with spans of time so immense
that they are scarcely comprehensible. Geology is a science
of time as well as rocks, and in our geologic story of the
Teton region we must refer frequently to the geologic time
scale, the yardstick by which we measure the vast reaches
of time in earth history.</p>
<h3 id="c26">Rocks and relative age</h3>
<p>Very early in the science of geology it was recognized
that in many places one can tell the comparative ages of
rocks by their relations to one another. For example, most
<i>sedimentary rocks</i> are consolidated accumulations of large
or small rock fragments and were deposited as nearly horizontal
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
layers of gravel, sand, or mud. In an undisturbed
sequence of sedimentary rocks, the layer on the bottom was
deposited first and the layer on top was deposited last. All
of these must, of course, be younger than any previously
formed rock fragments incorporated in them.</p>
<p><i>Igneous rocks</i> are those formed by solidification of
molten material, either as lava flows on the earth&rsquo;s surface
(<i>extrusive igneous rocks</i>) or at depth within the earth
(<i>intrusive igneous rocks</i>). The relative ages of extrusive
igneous rocks can often be determined in much the same
way as those of sedimentary strata. A lava flow is younger
than the rocks on which it rests, but older than those that
rest on top of it.</p>
<p>An intrusive igneous rock must be younger than the
rocks that enclosed it at the time it solidified. It may contain
pieces of the enclosing rocks that broke off the walls
and fell into the liquid. Pebbles of the igneous rock that
are incorporated in nearby sedimentary layers indicate
that the sediments must be somewhat younger.</p>
<p>All of these criteria tell us only that one rock is older
or younger than another. They tell us little about the absolute
age of the rocks or about how much older one is than
the other.</p>
<h3 id="c27">Fossils and geologic time</h3>
<p>Fossils provide important clues to the ages of the rocks
in which they are found. The slow evolution of living things
through geologic time can be traced by a systematic study
of fossils. The fossils are then used to determine the relative
ages of the rocks that contain them and to establish a
geologic time scale that can be applied to fossil-bearing
rocks throughout the world. <a href="#fig18">Figure 18</a> shows the major
subdivisions of the last 600 million years of geologic time
and some forms of life that dominated the scene during
each of these intervals. Strata containing closely related
fossils are grouped into <i>systems</i>; the time interval during
which the strata comprising a particular system were deposited
is termed a <i>period</i>. The periods are subdivisions of
larger time units called <i>eras</i> and some are split into smaller
time units called <i>epochs</i>. Strata deposited during an epoch
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
comprise a <i>series</i>. Series are in turn subdivided into rock
units called <i>groups</i> and formations. Expressed in tabular
form these divisions are:</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr class="th"><th>Subdivisions of geologic time </th><th class="l">Time-rock units </th><th class="l">Rock units</th></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Era</td></tr>

<tr><td class="l"> </td><td class="l"> </td><td class="l"><span class="hst">Formation</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>The time scale based on the study of fossil-bearing
sedimentary rocks is called the stratigraphic time scale; it
is given in <a href="#table1">table 1</a>. The subdivisions are arranged in the
same order in which they were deposited, with the oldest at
the bottom and the youngest at the top. All rocks older than
Cambrian (the first period in the Paleozoic Era) are
classed as Precambrian. These rocks are so old that fossils
are rare and therefore cannot be conveniently used as a
basis for subdivision.</p>
<p>The stratigraphic time scale is extremely useful, but it
has serious drawbacks. It can be applied only to fossil-bearing
strata or to rocks whose ages are determined by
their relation to those containing fossils. It cannot be used
directly for rocks that lack fossils, such as igneous rocks,
or metamorphic rocks in which fossils have been destroyed
by heat or pressure. It is used to establish the relative ages
of sedimentary strata throughout the world, but it gives no
information as to how long ago a particular layer was
deposited or how many years a given period or era lasted.</p>
<h3 id="c28">Radioactive clocks</h3>
<p>The measurement of geologic time in terms of years
was not possible until the discovery of natural radioactivity.
It was found that certain atoms of a few elements spontaneously
throw off particles from their nuclei and break
down to form atoms of other elements. These decay processes
take place at constant rates, unaffected by heat, pressure,
or chemical conditions. If we know the rate at which
a particular radioactive element decays, the length of time
that has passed since a mineral crystal containing the elements
formed can be calculated by comparing the amount
of the radioactive element remaining in the crystal with the
amount of disintegration products present.</p>

<p>Three principal radioactive clocks now in use are
based on the decay of uranium to lead, rubidium to strontium,
and potassium to argon. They are effective in dating
minerals millions or billions of years old. Another clock,
based on the decay of one type of carbon (<i>Carbon-14</i>) to
nitrogen, dates organic material, but only if it is less than
about 40,000 years old.</p>
<p>The uranium, rubidium, and potassium clocks are
especially useful in dating igneous rocks. By determining
the absolute ages of igneous rocks whose stratigraphic relations
to fossil-bearing strata are known, it is possible to
estimate the number of years represented by the various
subdivisions of the stratigraphic time scale.</p>
<h3 id="c29">The yardstick of geologic time</h3>
<p>Recent estimates suggest that the earth was formed at
least 4.5 billion years ago. To visualize the length of geologic
time and the relations between the stratigraphic and
absolute time scales, let us imagine a yardstick as representing
the length of time from the origin of the earth to the
present (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>). On one side of the yardstick we plot time
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
in years; on the other, we plot the divisions of the stratigraphic
time scale according to the most reliable absolute
age determinations.</p>

<p>We are immediately struck by the fact that all of the
subdivisions of the stratigraphic time scale since the beginning
of the Paleozoic are compressed into the last 5 inches
of our yardstick! All of the other 31 inches represent Precambrian
time. We also see that subdivisions of the stratigraphic
time scale do not represent equal numbers of years.
We use smaller and smaller subdivisions as we approach
the present. (Notice the subdivisions of the Tertiary and
Quaternary in <a href="#table1">table 1</a> that are too small to show even in the
enlarged part of <a href="#fig19">figure 19</a>). This is because the record of
earth history is more vague and incomplete the farther back
in time we go. In effect, we are very nearsighted in our
view of time. This &ldquo;geological myopia&rdquo; becomes increasingly
evident throughout the remainder of this booklet.</p>

<h2 id="c30"><br /><span class="small">PRECAMBRIAN ROCKS&mdash;THE CORE OF THE TETONS</span></h2>
<p>The visitor who looks at the high, rugged peaks of the
Teton Range is seeing rocks that record about seven-eighths
of all geologic time. These Precambrian rocks are part of
the very foundation of the continent and are therefore commonly
referred to by geologists as basement rocks. In attempting
to decipher their origin and history we peer backward
through the dim mists of time, piecing together
scattered clues to events that occurred billions of years ago,
perhaps during the very birth of the North American Continent.
To cite an oft-quoted example, it is as though we
were attempting to read the history of an ancient and long-forgotten
civilization from the scattered unnumbered pages
of a torn manuscript, written in a language that we only
partially understand.</p>
<h3 id="c31">Ancient gneisses and schists</h3>
<p>The oldest Precambrian rocks in the Teton Range are
layered gneisses and schists exposed over wide areas in the
northern and southern parts of the range and as scattered
isolated masses in the younger granite that forms the high
peaks in the central parts. The layered gneisses may be
seen easily along the trails in the lower parts of Indian
Paintbrush and Death Canyons, and near Static Peak.</p>
<p>The <i>layered gneisses</i> are composed principally of
quartz, feldspar, <i>biotite</i> (black mica), and <i>hornblende</i>
(a very dark-green or black mineral commonly forming
rodlike crystals). Distinct layers, a few inches to several
feet thick, contain different proportions of these minerals
and account for the banded appearance. Layers composed
almost entirely of quartz and feldspar are light-gray or
white, whereas darker gray layers contain higher proportions
of biotite and hornblende.</p>
<p>Some layers are dark-green to black <i>amphibolite</i>,
composed principally of hornblende but with a little feldspar
and quartz. In many places the gneisses include layers
of <i>schist</i>, a flaky rock, much of which is mica. At several
places on the east slopes of Mount Moran thin layers
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
of impure gray marble are found interleaved with the
gneisses. West of Static Peak along the Alaska Basin Trail
a heavy dark rock with large amounts of <i>magnetite</i> (strongly
magnetic black iron oxide) occurs as layers in the gneiss.</p>
<p>In some places the gneiss contains dark-reddish crystals
of garnet as much as an inch in diameter. Commonly
the garnet crystals are surrounded by white &ldquo;halos&rdquo; which
lack biotite or hornblende, probably because the constituents
necessary to form these minerals were absorbed by the
garnet crystals. In Death Canyon and on the slopes of
Static Peak some layers of gray gneiss contain egg-shaped
masses of magnetite as much as one-half inch in diameter
(<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>). These masses are likewise surrounded by elliptical
white halos and have the startling appearance of small
eyes peering from the rock. Appropriately, this rock has
been called the &ldquo;bright-eyed&rdquo; gneiss by Prof. Charles C.
Bradley in his published study (Wyoming Geological Association,
1956) of this area.</p>
<p>What were the ancient rocks from which the gneisses
of the Teton Range were formed? Most of the evidence has
been obliterated but a few remaining clues enable us to
draw some general conclusions. The banded appearance of
many of the gneisses suggests that they were formed from
sedimentary and volcanic rocks that accumulated on the sea
floor near a chain of volcanic islands&mdash;perhaps somewhat
similar to the modern Aleutians or the islands of Indonesia.
When these deposits were buried deep in the earth&rsquo;s crust
the chemical composition of some layers may have undergone
radical changes. Other layers, however, still have
compositions resembling those of younger rocks elsewhere
whose origins are better known. For example, the layers
of impure marble were probably once beds of sandy limestone,
and the lighter colored gneiss may have been muddy
sandstone, possibly containing volcanic ash. Some dark
amphibolite layers could represent altered lava flows or
beds of volcanic ash; others may have resulted from the addition
of silica to muddy magnesium-rich limestone during
metamorphism. The magnetite-rich gneiss probably was
originally a sedimentary iron ore.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 20. <i>&ldquo;Bright-eyed&rdquo;
gneiss from Death Canyon.
The dark magnetite spots are
about &frac14; inch in diameter.
The surrounding gneiss is
composed of quartz, feldspar,
and biotite, but biotite is
missing in the white halos
around the magnetite.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Minerals that were most easily altered at depth reacted
with one another to form new minerals more &ldquo;at home&rdquo;
under the high temperature and pressure in this environment
just as the ingredients in a cake react when heated in
an oven. Rocks formed by such processes are called <i>metamorphic
rocks</i>; careful studies of the minerals that they contain
suggest that the layered gneisses developed at temperatures
as high as 1000&deg;F at depths of 5 to 10 miles. Under
these conditions the rocks must have behaved somewhat like
soft taffy as is shown by layers that have been folded
nearly double without being broken (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>). Folds such
as these range from fractions of an inch to thousands of feet
across and are found in gneisses throughout the Teton
Range. In a few places folds are superimposed in such a
way as to indicate that the rocks were involved in several
episodes of deformation in response to different sets of
stress during metamorphism.</p>
<p>When did these gneisses form? Age determinations of
minerals containing radioactive elements show that granite
which was intruded into them after they were metamorphosed
and folded is more than 2.5 billion years old. They
must, therefore, be older than that. Thus, they probably
are at least a billion years older than rocks containing the
first faint traces of life on earth and 2 billion years older
than the oldest rocks containing abundant fossils. How
much older is not known, but the gneisses are certainly
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
among the oldest rocks in North America and record some
of the earliest events in the building of this continent.</p>

</div>
<p>Irregular bodies of granite gneiss are interleaved with
the layered gneisses in the northern part of the Teton
Range. The <i>granite gneiss</i> is relatively coarse grained,
streaky gray or pink, and composed principally of quartz,
feldspar, biotite, and hornblende. It differs from enclosing
layered gneisses in its coarser texture, lack of layering, and
more uniform appearance. The dark minerals (biotite and
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
hornblende) are concentrated in thin discontinuous wisps
that give the rock its streaky appearance.</p>
<p>The largest body of granite gneiss is exposed in a belt
1 to 2 miles wide and 10 miles long extending northeastward
from near the head of Moran Canyon, across the upper
part of Moose Basin, and into the lower reaches of
Webb Canyon. This gneiss may have been formed from
granite that invaded the ancient sedimentary and volcanic
rocks before they were metamorphosed, or it may have been
formed during metamorphism from some of the sediments
and volcanics themselves.</p>
<p>At several places in Snowshoe, Waterfalls, and Colter
Canyons the layered gneisses contain discontinuous masses
a few tens or hundreds of feet in diameter of heavy dark-green
or black <i>serpentine</i>. This rock is frequently called
&ldquo;<i>soapstone</i>&rdquo; because the surface feels smooth and soapy to
the touch. Indians carved bowls (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>) from similar material
obtained from the west side of the Tetons and from
the Gros Ventre Mountains to the southeast. Pebbles of serpentine
along streams draining the west side of the Tetons
have been cut and polished for jewelry and sold as &ldquo;<i>Teton
jade</i>&rdquo;; it is much softer and less lustrous than real jade.
The serpentine was formed by metamorphism of dark-colored
igneous rocks lacking quartz and feldspar.</p>
<h3 id="c32">Granite and pegmatite</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, <i>granite</i> (crystalline igneous
rock composed principally of quartz and feldspar)
forms only a part of the Teton Range. The Grand Teton
(<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) and most surrounding subsidiary peaks are sculptured
from an irregular mass of granite exposed continuously
along the backbone of the range from Buck Mountain
northward toward upper Leigh Canyon. The rock is commonly
fine grained, white or light-gray, and is largely composed
of crystals of gray quartz and white feldspar about
the size and texture of the grains in very coarse lump sugar.
Flakes of black or dark-brown mica (biotite) and silvery
white mica (<i>muscovite</i>) about the size of grains of pepper
are scattered through the rock.</p>
<p>From the floor of Jackson Hole the granite cliffs and
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
buttresses of the high peaks appear nearly white in contrast
to the more somber grays and browns of surrounding gneisses
and schists. These dark rocks are laced by a network of
irregular light-colored granite dikes ranging in thickness
from fractions of an inch to tens of feet (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>).</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 22. <i>Indian bowls carved from
soapstone, probably from the Teton
Range. Mouth of the unbroken bowl is
about 4 inches in diameter.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The largest masses of granite contain abundant unoriented
angular blocks and slabs of the older gneisses. These
inclusions range from a few inches in diameter (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>) to
slabs hundreds of feet thick and thousands of feet long.</p>
<p>Dikes or irregular intrusions of pegmatite are found
in almost every exposure of granite. <i>Pegmatite</i> contains
the same minerals as granite but the individual mineral
crystals are several inches or even as much as a foot in
diameter.</p>
<p>Some pegmatites contain silvery plates or tabular crystals
of muscovite mica as much as 6 inches across that can
be split into transparent sheets with a pocket knife. Others
have dark-brown biotite mica in crystals about the size and
shape of the blade of a table knife.</p>
<p>A few pegmatites contain scattered red-brown crystals
of garnet ranging in size from that of a BB shot to a small
marble; a few in Garnet Canyon and Glacier Gulch are
larger than baseballs (<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>). The garnets are fractured
and many are partly altered to <i>chlorite</i> (a dull-green micaceous
mineral) so they are of no value as gems.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Pegmatite <i>dikes</i> (tabular bodies of rock that, while
still molten, were forced along fractures in older rocks)
commonly cut across granite dikes, but in many places the
reverse is true. Some dikes are composed of layers of pegmatite
alternating with layers of granite (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>), showing
that the pegmatite and granite are nearly contemporaneous.
Prof. Bruno Giletti and his coworkers at Brown University,
using the rubidium-strontium radioactive clock, determined
that the granite and pegmatite in the Teton Range are about
2.5 billion years old.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 24. <i>Angular blocks of old streaky granite gneiss in fine-grained
granite northwest of Lake Solitude. The difference in orientation of the
streaks in the gneiss blocks indicates that the blocks have been rotated with
respect to one another and that the fine-grained granite must therefore have
been liquid at the time of intrusion. A small light-colored dike in the upper
left-hand block of gneiss ends at the edge of the block; it intruded the gneiss
before the block was broken off and incorporated in the granite. A small
dike of pegmatite cuts diagonally through the granite just to the left of the
hammer and extends into the blocks of gneiss at both ends. This dike was
intruded after the granite had solidified. Thus, in this one small exposure we
can recognize four ages of rocks: the streaky granite gneiss, the light-colored
dike, the fine-grained granite, and the small pegmatite dike.</i></p>

<h3 id="c33">Black dikes</h3>
<p>Even the most casual visitor to the Teton Range notices
the remarkable black band that extends down the east face
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
of Mount Moran (figs. <a href="#fig27">27</a> and <a href="#fig28">28</a>) from the summit and
disappears into the trees north of Leigh Lake. This is the
outcropping edge of a steeply inclined dike composed of
<i>diabase</i>, a nearly black igneous rock very similar to basalt.
Thinner diabase dikes are visible on the east face of Middle
Teton, on the south side of the Grand Teton, and in several
other places in the range (see <a href="#fig62">geologic map</a> inside back cover).</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 25. <i>Garnet crystal in pegmatite. The crystal is about 6 inches in
diameter. Other minerals are feldspar (white) and clusters of white mica
flakes. The mica crystals appear dark in the photograph because they are
wet.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The diabase is a heavy dark-greenish-gray to black
rock that turns rust brown on faces that have been exposed
to the weather. It is studded with small lath-shaped crystals
of feldspar that are greenish gray in the fresh rock and
milk white on weathered surfaces.</p>
<p>The black dikes formed from molten rock that welled
up into nearly vertical fissures in the older Precambrian
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
rocks. Toward the edges of the dikes the feldspar laths in
the diabase become smaller and smaller (<a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>), indicating
that the wall rocks were relatively cool when the
<i>magma</i> or melted rock was intruded. Rapid chilling at the
edges prevented growth of large crystals. In many places
hot solutions from the dike permeated the wall rocks, staining
them rosy red.</p>

in the enclosing gneisses and must therefore have been intruded after
development of the folds. The white ruler is about 6 inches long.</i></p>

<p>The black dike on Mount Moran is about 150 feet thick
near the summit of the peak. This dike has been traced
westward for more than 7 miles. Where it passes out of the
park south of Green Lakes Mountain it is 100 feet thick.
The amount of molten material needed to form the exposed
segment of this single dike could fill Jenny Lake three
times over. The other dikes are thinner and not as long: the
dike on Middle Teton is 20 to 40 feet thick, and the dike on
Grand Teton is 40 to 60 feet thick.</p>

</div>
<p>The black dikes must be the youngest of the Precambrian
units because they cut across all other Precambrian
rocks. The dikes must have been intruded before the beginning
of Cambrian deposition inasmuch as they do not cut
the oldest Cambrian beds. Gneiss adjacent to the dike on
Mount Moran contains biotite that was heated and altered
about 1.3 billion years ago according to Professor Giletti.
The alteration is believed to have occurred when the dike
was emplaced; therefore this and similar dikes elsewhere
in the range are probably about 1.3 billion years old.</p>
<h3 id="c34">Quartzite</h3>
<p>At about the same time as the dikes were being intruded
in the Tetons, many thousands of feet of sedimentary
rocks, chiefly sandstone, were deposited in western Montana,
200 miles northwest of Grand Teton National Park.
The sandstone was later recrystallized and recemented and
became a very dense hard rock called <i>quartzite</i>. Similar
quartzite, possibly part of the same deposit, was laid down
west of the north end of the Teton Range, within the area
now called the Snake River downwarp (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>).</p>
<p>The visitor who hikes or camps anywhere on the floor
of Jackson Hole becomes painfully aware of the thousands
upon thousands of remarkably rounded hard quartzite
boulders. He wonders where they came from because nowhere
in the adjacent mountains is this rock type exposed.
The answer is that the quartzites were derived from a long-vanished
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
uplift (figs. <a href="#fig42">42</a> and <a href="#fig46">46</a>), carried eastward by
powerful rivers past the north end of the Teton Range, and
then were deposited in a vast sheet of gravel that covered
much of Jackson Hole 60 to 80 million years ago. Since
then, these virtually indestructible boulders have been re-worked
many times by streams and ice, yet still retain the
characteristics of the original ancient sediments.</p>
<h3 id="c35">A backward glance</h3>
<p>So far we have seen that the Precambrian basement
exposed in the Teton Range contains a complex array of
rocks of diverse origins and various ages. Before passing
on to the younger rocks, reference to our yardstick may
help to place the Precambrian events in their proper
perspective.</p>
<p>In all of Precambrian time, which encompasses more
than 85 percent of the history of the earth (31 of the 36
inches of our yardstick), only two events are dated in the
Teton Range: the intrusion of granite and pegmatite about
2.5 billion years ago, and the emplacement of the black
dikes about 1.3 billion years ago. These dates are indicated
by heavy arrows on the time scale (<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>). The ancient
gneisses and schists were formed sometime before 2.5 billion
years ago, and probably are no older than 3.5 billion
years, the age of the oldest rocks dated anywhere in the
world.</p>
<h3 id="c36">The close of the Precambrian&mdash;end of the beginning</h3>
<p>More than 700 million years elapsed between intrusion
of the black dikes and deposition of the first Paleozic
sedimentary rocks&mdash;a longer period of time than has
elapsed since the beginning of the Paleozic Era. During
this enormous interval the Precambrian rocks were uplifted,
exposed to erosion, and gradually worn to a nearly
featureless plain, perhaps somewhat resembling the vast
flat areas in which similar Precambrian rocks are now exposed
in central and eastern Canada. At the close of Precambrian
time, about 600 million years ago, the plain slowly
floundered and the site of the future Teton Range disappeared
beneath shallow seas that were to wash across it intermittently
for the next 500 million years. It is to the
sediments deposited in these seas that we turn to read the
next chapter in the geologic story of the Teton Range.</p>

<h2 id="c37"><br /><span class="small">THE PALEOZOIC ERA&mdash;TIME OF LONG-VANISHED SEAS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE</span></h2>
<h3 id="c38">The Paleozoic sequence</h3>
<p>North, west, and south of the highest Teton peaks the
soaring spires and knife-edge ridges of Precambrian rock
give way to rounded spurs and lower flat-topped summits,
whose slopes are palisaded by continuous gray cliffs that
resemble the battlements of some ancient and long-abandoned
fortress (<a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>). As mentioned previously, the
cliffs are the projecting edges of layers of sedimentary
rocks of Paleozoic age that accumulated in or along the
margins of shallow seas. At one time the layers formed a
thick unbroken, nearly horizontal blanket across the Precambrian
basement rocks, but subsequent uplift of the eastern
edge of the Teton fault block tilted them westward.
They were then stripped from the highest peaks.</p>
<p>The Paleozoic and younger sedimentary rocks in the
Teton region are subdivided into <i>formations</i>, each of which
is named. A formation is composed of rock layers which,
because of their similar physical characteristics, can be distinguished
from overlying and underlying layers. They
must be thick enough to be shown on a geologic map. <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>
lists the various Paleozoic formations present in and adjacent
to Grand Teton National Park and gives their thicknesses
and characteristics. These sedimentary rocks are of
special interest, for they not only record an important
chapter of geologic history but elsewhere in the region they
contain petroleum and other mineral deposits.</p>
<p>The Paleozoic rocks can be viewed close at hand from
the top of the Teton Village tram (<a href="#fig32">fig. 32</a>) on the south
boundary of the park. A less accessible but equally spectacular
exposure of Paleozoic rocks is in Alaska Basin,
along the west margin of the park, where they are stacked
like even layers in a gigantic cake (<a href="#fig33">fig. 33</a>).</p>
<h3 id="c39">Alaska Basin&mdash;site of an outstanding rock and fossil record</h3>
<p>Strata in Alaska Basin record with unusual clarity the
opening chapters in the chronicle of seas that flowed and
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
ebbed across the future site of the Teton Range during most
of the Paleozoic Era. In the various rock layers are inscribed

<p>The regularity and parallel relations of the layers in
well-exposed sections such as the one in Alaska Basin suggest
that all these rocks were deposited in a single uninterrupted
sequence. However, the fossils and regional distribution
of the rock units show that this is not really the
case. The incomplete nature of this record becomes apparent
if we plot the ages of the various formations on the
absolute geologic time scale (<a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>). The length of time
from the beginning of the Cambrian Period to the end of
the Mississippian Period is about 285 million years. The
strata in Alaska Basin are a record of approximately 120
million years. More than half of the pages in the geologic
story are missing even though, compared with most other
areas, the book as a whole is remarkably complete! During
these unrecorded intervals of time either no sediments were
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
deposited in the area of the Teton Range or, if deposited,
they were removed by erosion.</p>

<h3 id="c40">Advance and retreat of Cambrian seas: an example</h3>
<p>The first invasion and retreat of the Paleozoic sea are
sketched on <a href="#fig35">figure 35</a>. Early in Cambrian time a shallow
seaway, called the <i>Cordilleran trough</i>, extended from
southern California northeastward across Nevada into Utah
and Idaho (<a href="#fig35A">fig. 35A</a>). The vast gently rolling plain on Precambrian
rocks to the east was drained by sluggish westward-flowing
rivers that carried sand and mud into the sea.
Slow subsidence of the land caused the sea to spread gradually
eastward. Sand accumulated along the beaches just
as it does today. As the sea moved still farther east, mud
was deposited on the now-submerged beach sand. In the
Teton area, the oldest sand deposit is called the Flathead
Sandstone (<a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>).</p>
<p>The mud laid down on top of the Flathead Sandstone
as the shoreline advanced eastward across the Teton area is
now called the Wolsey Shale Member of the Gros Ventre
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
Formation. Some shale shows patterns of cracks that
formed when the accumulating mud was briefly exposed to
the air along tidal flats. Small phosphatic-shelled animals
called <i>brachiopods</i> inhabited these lonely tidal flats (fig.
<a href="#fig37A">37A</a> and <a href="#fig37B">37B</a>) but as far as is known, nothing lived on land.
Many shale beds are marked with faint trails and borings
of wormlike creatures, and a few contain the remains of
tiny very intricately developed creatures with head, eyes,
segmented body, and tail. These are known as trilobites
(fig. <a href="#fig37C">37C</a> and <a href="#fig37D">37D</a>). Descendants of these lived in various
seas that crossed the site of the dormant Teton Range for
the next 250 million years.</p>

<p>As the shoreline moved eastward, the Death Canyon
Limestone Member of the Gros Ventre Formation (<a href="#fig33">fig. 33</a>)
was deposited in clear water farther from shore. Following
this the sea retreated to the west for a short time. In the
shallow muddy water resulting from this retreat the Park
Shale Member of the Gros Ventre Formation was deposited.
In places underwater &ldquo;meadows&rdquo; of algae flourished on the
sea bottom and built extensive reefs (<a href="#fig38A">fig. 38A</a>). From time
to time shoal areas were hit by violent storm waves that tore
loose platy fragments of recently solidified limestone and
swept them into nearby channels where they were buried
and cemented into thin beds of jumbled fragments (<a href="#fig38B">fig. 38B</a>)
called <i>&ldquo;edgewise&rdquo; conglomerate</i>. These are widespread
in the shale and in overlying and underlying limestones.</p>

<p>Once again the shoreline crept eastward, the seas
cleared, and the Gallatin Limestone was deposited. The
Gallatin, like the Death Canyon Limestone Member, was
laid down for the most part in quiet, clear water, probably
at depths of 100 to 200 feet. However, a few beds of &ldquo;edgewise&rdquo;
conglomerate indicate the occurrence of sporadic
storms. At this time, the sea covered all of Idaho and Montana
and most of Wyoming (<a href="#fig35B">fig. 35B</a>) and extended eastward
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
across the Dakotas to connect with shallow seas that
covered the eastern United States. Soon after this maximum
stage was reached slow uplift caused the sea to retreat gradually
westward. The site of the Teton Range emerged
above the waves, where, as far as is now known, it may have
been exposed to erosion for nearly 70 million years (<a href="#fig35C">fig. 35C</a>).</p>

<p>The Bighorn Dolomite of Ordovician age forms ragged
hard massive light-gray to white cliffs 100 to 200 feet
high (figs. <a href="#fig32">32</a> and <a href="#fig33">33</a>). <i>Dolomite</i> is a calcium-magnesium
carbonate, but the original sediment probably was a calcium
carbonate mud that was altered by magnesium-rich
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
sea water shortly after deposition. Corals and other marine
animals were abundant in the clear warm seas at this time.</p>
<p>Dolomite in the Darby Formation of Devonian age differs
greatly from the Bighorn Dolomite; that in the Darby
is dark-brown to almost black, has an oily smell, and contains
layers of black, pink, and yellow mudstone and thin
sandstone. The sea bottom during deposition of these rocks
was foul and frequently the water was turbid. Abundant
fossil fragments indicate fishes were common for the first
time. Exposures of the Darby Formation are recognizable
by their distinctive dull-yellow thin-layered slopes between
the prominent gray massive cliffs of formations below and
above.</p>
<p>The Madison Limestone of Mississippian age is 1,000
feet thick and is exposed in spectacular vertical cliffs along
canyons in the north, west, and south parts of the Tetons.
It is noted for the abundant remains of beautifully preserved
marine organisms (<a href="#fig39">fig. 39</a>). The fossils and the relatively
pure blue-gray limestone in which they are embedded
indicate deposition in warm tranquil seas. The
beautiful Ice Cave on the west side of the Tetons and all
other major caves in the region were dissolved out of this
rock by underground water.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvanian System is represented by the Amsden
Formation and the Tensleep Sandstone. Cliffs of the
Tensleep Sandstone can be seen along the Gros Ventre
River at the east edge of the park. The Amsden, below the
Tensleep, consists of red and green shale, sandstone, and
thin limestone. The shale is especially weak and slippery
when exposed to weathering and saturated with water.
These are the strata that make up the glide plane of the
Lower Gros Ventre Slide (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>) east of the park.</p>
<p>The Phosphoria Formation and its equivalents of Permian
age are unlike any other Paleozoic rocks because of
their extraordinary content of uncommon elements. The
formation consists of sandy dolomite, widespread black
phosphate beds and black shale that is unusually rich not
only in phosphorus, but also in vanadium, uranium, chromium,
zinc, selenium, molybdenum, cobalt, and silver. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
formation is mined extensively in nearby parts of Idaho
and in Wyoming for phosphatic fertilizer, for the chemical
element phosphorus, and for some of the metals that can be
derived from the rocks as byproducts. These elements and
compounds are not everywhere concentrated enough to be
of economic interest, but their dollar value is, in a regional
sense, comparable to that of some of the world&rsquo;s greatest
mineral deposits.</p>

<h2 id="c42"><br /><span class="small">THE MESOZOIC&mdash;ERA OF TRANSITION</span></h2>
<p>The Mesozoic Era in the Teton region was a time of
alternating marine, transitional, and continental environments.
Moreover, the highly diversified forms of life, ranging
from marine mollusks to tremendous, land-living dinosaurs,
confirm and reinforce the story of the rocks. Living
things, too, were in transition, for as environment changed,
many forms moved from the sea to land in order to survive.
It was the time when some of the most spectacularly colored
rock strata of the region were deposited.</p>
<h3 id="c43">Colorful first Mesozoic strata</h3>
<p>Bright-red soft Triassic rocks more than 1,000 feet
thick, known as the Chugwater Formation, comprise most
of the basal part of the Mesozoic sequence (<a href="#table4">table 4</a>). They
form colorful hills east and south of the park. The red color
is caused by a minor amount of iron oxide. Mud cracks and
the presence of fossil reptiles and amphibians indicate
deposition in a tidal flat environment, with the sea lying
several miles southwest of Jackson Hole. A few beds of
white <i>gypsum</i> (calcium sulfate) are present; they were apparently
deposited during evaporation of shallow bodies of
salt water cut off from the open sea.</p>
<p>As the Triassic Period gave way to the Jurassic, salmon-red
windblown sand (Nugget Sandstone) spread
across the older red beds and in turn was buried by thin red
shale and thick gypsum deposits of the Gypsum Spring
Formation. Then down from Alaska and spreading across
most of Wyoming came the <i>Sundance Sea</i>, a warm, muddy,
shallow body of water that teemed with marine mollusks. In
it more than 500 feet of highly fossiliferous soft gray shale
and thin limestones and sandstones were deposited. The
sea withdrew and the Morrison and Cloverly Formations
(Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous) were deposited on low-lying
tropical humid flood plains. These rocks are colorful,
consisting of red, pink, purple, and green badland-forming
claystones and mudstones, and yellow to buff sandstones.
Vegetation was abundant and large and small dinosaurs
roamed the countryside or inhabited the swamps.</p>

<h3 id="c44">Drab Cretaceous strata</h3>
<p>The youngest division of the <i>Mesozoic</i> Era is the
Cretaceous Period. Near the beginning of this period,
brightly colored rocks continued to be deposited. Then, the
Teton region, as well as most of Wyoming, was partly, and
at times completely, submerged by shallow muddy seas. As
a result, the brightly variegated strata were covered by
10,000 feet of generally drab-colored sand, silt, and clay
containing some coal beds, volcanic ash layers, and minor
amounts of gravel.</p>
<p>The Cretaceous sea finally retreated eastward from
the Teton region about 85 million years ago, following the
deposition of the Bacon Ridge Sandstone (<a href="#fig40">fig. 40</a>). As it
withdrew, extensive coal swamps developed along the sea
coast. The record of these swamps is preserved in coal beds
5 to 10 feet thick in the Upper Cretaceous deposits. The
coal beds are now visible in abandoned mines along the east
margin of the park. Coal is formed from compacted plant
debris; about 5 feet of this material is needed to form 1
inch of coal. Thus, lush vegetation must have flourished
for long periods of time, probably in a hot wet climate similar
to that now prevailing in the Florida Everglades.</p>
<p>Sporadically throughout Cretaceous time fine-grained
ash was blown out of volcanoes to the west and northwest
and deposited in quiet shallow water. Subsequently the ash
was altered to a type of clay called <i>bentonite</i> that is used
in the foundry industry and in oil well drilling muds. In
Jackson Hole, the elk and deer lick bentonite exposures to
get a bitter salt and, where the beds are water-saturated, enjoy
&ldquo;stomping&rdquo; on them. Bentonite swells when wet and
causes many landslides along access roads into Jackson
Hole (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>).</p>
<p>The Cretaceous rocks in the Teton region are part of
an enormous east-thinning wedge that here is nearly 2 miles
thick. Most of the debris was derived from slowly rising
mountains to the west.</p>
<p>Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are much more than of
just scientific interest; they contain mineral deposits important
to the economy of Wyoming and of the nation.
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
Wyoming leads the States in production of bentonite, all of
it from Cretaceous rocks. These strata have yielded far
more oil and gas than any other geologic system in the State
and the production is geographically widespread. They
also contain enormous coal reserves, some in beds between
50 and 100 feet thick. The energy resources alone of the
Cretaceous System in Wyoming make it invaluable to our
industrialized society.</p>

<p>As the end of the Cretaceous Period approached,
slightly more than 80 million years ago, the flat monotonous
landscape (<a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>) which had prevailed during
most of Late Cretaceous time gave little hint that the stage
was set for one of the most exciting and important chapters
in the geologic history of North America.</p>
<h3 id="c45">Birth of the Rocky Mountains</h3>
<p>The episode of mountain building that resulted in formation
of the ancestral Rocky Mountains has long been
known as the <i>Laramide Revolution</i>. West and southwest of
Wyoming, mountains had already formed, the older ones as
far away as Nevada and as far back in time as Jurassic,
the younger ones rising progressively farther east, like
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
giant waves moving toward a coast. The first crustal movement
in the Teton area began in latest Cretaceous time when
a broad low northwest-trending arch developed in the approximate
area of the present Teton Range and Gros Ventre
Mountains. However, this uplift bore no resemblance to the
Tetons as we know them today for the present range formed
70 million years later.</p>

sea still lingered in central Wyoming.</i></p>
</div>
<p>One bit of evidence (there are others) of the first
Laramide mountain building west of the Tetons is a tremendous
deposit of quartzite boulder debris (several hundred
cubic miles in volume) derived from the <i>Targhee uplift</i>
(<a href="#fig42">fig. 42</a>). Nowhere is the uplift now exposed, but from the
size, composition, and distribution of rock fragments that
came from it, we know that it was north and west of the
northern end of the present-day Teton Range. Powerful
streams carried boulders, sand, and clay eastward and
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
southeastward across the future site of Jackson Hole and
deposited them in the Harebell Formation (<a href="#table4">table 4</a>). Mingled
with this sediment were tiny flakes of gold and a small
amount of mercury. Fine-grained debris was carried still
farther east and southeast into two enormous depositional
troughs in central and southern Wyoming. Most of the
large rock fragments were derived from Precambrian and
possibly lower Paleozoic quartzites. This means that at
least 15,000 feet of overlying Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata
must first have been stripped away from the Targhee uplift
before the quartzites were exposed to erosion.</p>

</div>
<p>Near the end of Cretaceous time, broad gentle uplifts
also began to stir at the sites of future mountain ranges in
many parts of Wyoming. The ancestral Teton-Gros Ventre
arch continued to grow. Associated with and parallel to it
was a series of sharp steepsided elongated northwest-trending
upfolds (<i>anticlines</i>). One of these can be seen where it
crosses the highway at the Lava Creek Campground near
the eastern margin of Grand Teton National Park.</p>
<p>During these episodes of mountain building, erosion,
and deposition, the dinosaurs became extinct all over the
world. The &ldquo;Age of Mammals&rdquo; was about to begin.</p>

<p>The Cenozoic (<a href="#table1">table 1</a>), last and shortest of the geologic
eras, comprises the Tertiary and Quaternary Periods.
It began about 65 million years ago and is represented by
only the final one-half inch of our imaginary yardstick of
time (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>). Nevertheless, it is the era during which the
Tetons rose in their present form and the landscape was
sculptured into the panorama of beauty that we now see. In
order to show the many Tertiary and Quaternary events in
the Teton region, it is necessary to enlarge greatly the last
part of the yardstick (<a href="#fig44">fig. 44</a>). There are two reasons for
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
the extraordinarily clear and complete record. First, the
Teton region was a relatively active part of the earth&rsquo;s crust,
characterized by many downdropped blocks. The number
of events is great and their records are preserved in sediments
trapped in the subsiding basins. Second, the geologically
recent past is much easier to see than the far dimmer,
distant past; the rocks that record later events are
fresher, less altered, more complete, and more easily interpreted
than are those that tell us of older events.</p>

<p>During the early part of the Tertiary Period, mountain
building and basin subsidence were the dominant types
of crustal movement. Seas retreated southward down the
Mississippi Valley and never again invaded the Teton area.
Environments on the recently uplifted land were diverse
and favorable for the development of new forms of plants
and animals.</p>
<h3 id="c47">Rise and burial of mountains</h3>
<p>The enormous section of Tertiary sedimentary rocks
in the Jackson Hole area (<a href="#table5">table 5</a>) is one of the most impressive
in North America. If the maximum thicknesses of
all formations were added, they would total more than 6
miles, but nowhere did this amount of rock accumulate in a
single unbroken sequence. No other region in the United
States contains a thicker or more complete nonmarine Tertiary
record; many areas have little or none. The accumulation
in Jackson Hole reflects active uplifts of nearby
mountains that supplied abundant rock debris, concurrent
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
sinking of nearby basins in which the sediments could be
preserved, and proximity to the great Yellowstone-Absaroka
volcanic area, one of the most active continental volcanic
fields in the United States. The volume and composition
of the Tertiary strata are, therefore, clear evidence of
crustal and subcrustal instability.</p>

<p>The many thick layers of conglomerate are evidence

<p>Conglomerates such as the Pinyon are not the only
clue to the time of mountain building. Another type of evidence&mdash;faults&mdash;is
demonstrated in <a href="#fig16">figure 16</a>. The youngest
rocks cut by a fault are always older than the fault.
Many faults and the rocks on each side are covered by still
younger unbroken sediments. These must, therefore, have
been deposited after fault movement ceased. By dating
both the faulted and the overlying unbroken sediments, the
time of fault movement can be bracketed.</p>
<p>Observations of this type in western Wyoming indicate
that the Laramide Revolution reached a climax during
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
earliest Eocene time, 50 to 55 million years ago. Mountain-producing
upwarps formed during this episode were
commonly bounded on one side by either reverse or thrust
faults (fig. <a href="#fig16B">16B</a> and <a href="#fig16C">16C</a>) and intervening blocks were downfolded
into large, very deep basins. The amount of movement
of the mountain blocks over the basins ranged from
tens of miles in the Snake River, Salt River, Wyoming, and
Hoback Ranges directly south of the Tetons to less than 5
miles on the east margin of Jackson Hole (the west flank
of the Washakie Range shown in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>). The ancestral
Teton-Gros Ventre uplift continued to rise but remained
one of the less conspicuous mountain ranges in the region
(<a href="#fig47">fig. 47</a>).</p>
<p>The Buck Mountain fault, the great reverse fault
which lies just west of the highest Teton peaks (see <a href="#fig62">geologic map</a>
and <a href="#pic2">cross section</a>), was formed either at this time or
during a later episode of movement that also involved the
southwest margin of the Gros Ventre Mountains. The Buck
Mountain fault is of special importance because it raised a
segment of Precambrian rocks several thousand feet. Later,
when the entire range as we now know it was uplifted by
movement along the Teton fault, the hard basement rocks
in this previously upfaulted segment continued to stand
much higher than those in adjacent parts of the range. All
of the major peaks in the Tetons are carved from this
doubly uplifted block.</p>
<p>The brightly colored sandstone, mudstone, and claystone
in the Indian Meadows and Wind River Formations
(lower Eocene) in the eastern part of Jackson Hole were
derived from variegated Triassic, Jurassic, and Lower Cretaceous
rocks exposed on the adjacent mountain flanks.
Fossils in these Eocene Formations show that it took less
than 10 million years for the uplifts to be deeply eroded
and partially buried in their own debris.</p>
<p>The Laramide Revolution in the area of Grand Teton
National Park ended during Eocene time between 45 and
50 million years ago, and as the mountains and basins became
stabilized a new element was added. Volcanoes broke
through to the surface in many parts of the Yellowstone-Absaroka
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
area and the constantly increasing volume of
their eruptive debris was a major factor in the speed of
filling of basins and burial of mountains throughout Wyoming.
This entire process only took about 20 million years,
and along the east margin of Jackson Hole it was largely
completed during Oligocene time (<a href="#fig48">fig. 48</a>). However, east
and northeast of Jackson Lake a Miocene downwarp subsequently
formed and in it accumulated at least 7,000 feet of
locally derived sediments of volcanic origin.</p>

<h3 id="c48">The First Big Lake</h3>
<p><i>Teewinot Lake</i> (<a href="#fig49">fig. 49</a>), the first big freshwater lake
in Jackson Hole, was formed during Pliocene time, about
10 million years ago, and in it the Teewinot Formation was
deposited. These lake strata consist of more than 5,000
feet of white limestone, thin-bedded claystone, and <i>tuff</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
(solidified ash made up of tiny fragments of volcanic rock
and splinters of volcanic glass). The claystones contain fossil
snails, clams, beaver bones and teeth, aquatic mice,
suckers, and other fossils that indicate deposition in a shallow
freshwater lake environment. These beds underlie
Jackson Lake Lodge, the National Elk Refuge, part of
Blacktail Butte, and are conspicuously exposed in white
outcrops that look like snowbanks on the upper slopes along
the east margin of the park across the valley from the
Grand Teton.</p>

<p>Teewinot Lake was formed on a down-faulted block
and was dammed behind (north of) a fault that trends east
across the floor of Jackson Hole at the south boundary of
the park. Lakes are among the most short-lived of earth
features because the forces of nature soon conspire to fill
them up or empty them. This lake existed for perhaps 5
million years during middle Pliocene time; it was shallow,
and remained so despite the pouring in of a mile-thick layer
of sediment. This indicates that downdropping of the lake
floor just about kept pace with deposition.</p>

<p>Other lakes formed in response to similar crustal
movements in nearby places. One such lake, <i>Grand Valley
Lake</i> (<a href="#fig49">fig. 49</a>), formed about 25 miles southwest of Teewinot
Lake; both contained sediments with nearly the same
thickness, composition, appearance, age, and fossils. Although
these two lakes are on opposite sides of the Snake
River Range, the ancestral Snake River apparently flowed
through a canyon previously cut across the range and provided
a direct connection between them.</p>
<h3 id="c49">Development of mammals</h3>
<p>The Cenozoic Era is known as the &ldquo;Age of Mammals.&rdquo;
Small mammals had already existed, though quite inconspicuously,
in Wyoming for about 90 million years before
Paleocene time. Then about 65 million years ago their proliferation
began as a result of the extinction of dinosaurs,
obliteration of seaways that were barriers to distribution,
and the development of new and varied types of environment.
These new environments included savannah plains,
low hills and high mountains, freshwater lakes and swamps,
and extensive river systems. The mammals increased in
size and, for the first time, became abundant in numbers of
both species and individuals. The development and widespread
distribution of grasses and other forage on which
many of the animals depended were highly significant.
Successful adaptation of <i>herbivores</i> (vegetation-eating animals)
led, in turn, to increased varieties and numbers of
predatory <i>carnivores</i> (meat-eating animals).</p>
<p>During early Eocene time, coal swamps formed in
eastern Jackson Hole and persisted for thousands of years,
as is shown by 60 feet of coal in a single bed at one locality.
Continuing on into middle Eocene time, the climate was
subtropical and humid, and the terrain was near sea level.
Tropical breadfruits, figs, and magnolias flourished along
with a more temperate flora of redwood, hickory, maple,
and oak. Horses the size of a dog and many other small
mammals were abundant. Primates, thriving in an ideal
forest habitat, were numerous. Streams contained gar fish
and crocodiles (<a href="#fig50">fig. 50</a>).</p>

<p>Early in the Oligocene Epoch, between 30 and 35 million
years ago, the climate in Jackson Hole became cooler
and drier, and the subtropical plants gave way to the warm
temperate flora of oak, beech, maple, alder, and ash. The
general land surface rose higher above sea level, perhaps
by accumulation of several thousand feet of Oligocene volcanic
rocks (<a href="#fig52">fig. 52</a>) rather than by continental uplift.
<i>Titanotheres</i> (large four-legged mammals with the general
size and shape of a rhinoceros) flourished in great numbers
for a few million years and then abruptly vanished. Horses
by now were about the size of a very small modern colt.
Rabbits, rodents, carnivores, tiny camels, and other mammals
were abundant in Jackson Hole, and the fauna, surprisingly,
was essentially the same as that 500 miles to the
east, at a much lower elevation, on the plains of Nebraska
and South Dakota (<a href="#fig51">fig. 51</a>).</p>
<p>The Miocene Epoch (15 to 25 million years ago) was
the time of such intense volcanic activity in the Teton region
that animals must have found survival very difficult. A
few skeletons and fragmentary parts of camels about the
size of a small horse and other piglike animals called
<i>oreodonts</i> comprise our only record of mammals; nothing
is known of the plants. Farther east the climate fluctuated
from subtropical to warm temperate, gradually becoming
cooler toward the end of the epoch.</p>
<p>Fossils in the Pliocene lake deposits (8 to 10 million
years old; see description of Teewinot Formation) include
shallow-water types of snails, clams, diatoms, and ostracodes,
as well as beavers, mice, suckers, and frogs. Pollen
in these beds show that adjacent upland areas supported
fir, spruce, pine, juniper, sage, and other trees and shrubs
common to the area today. Therefore, the climate must
have been much cooler than in Miocene time. No large
mammals of Pliocene age have been found in Jackson Hole.
The record of life during Quaternary time is discussed
later.</p>

part of Wyoming.</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c50">Volcanoes</h3>
<p>Volcanoes are one of the most interesting parts of the
geologic story of the Teton region. Although ash from distant
volcanoes had settled in northwestern Wyoming at least
as far back in time as Jurassic, the first nearby active volcanoes
(since the Precambrian) erupted in the Yellowstone-Absaroka
region during the early Eocene, about 50 million
years ago. From then on, the volcanic area grew in size and
the violence of eruptions and volume of debris increased
until Pliocene time. This debris had a profound influence
on the color and composition of the sediments and on the
environment and types of plants and animals.</p>
<p>The color of the volcanic rocks and the sediments
derived from them varies significantly from one epoch to
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
another. For example, the middle Eocene rocks are white
to light-green, red, and purple, upper Eocene are dark-green,
Oligocene are light-gray, white, and brown, Miocene
are dark-green, brown, and gray, and Pliocene are white to
red-brown.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, it is probable that the vast outpouring

to the subsidence of Jackson Hole and the rise of the

<p>About 25 million years ago, with the start of the
Miocene Epoch, volcanic vents opened up within, and along
the borders of, Grand Teton National Park. Major centers
of eruption were at the north end of the Teton Range, east
of Jackson Lake, and south of Spread Creek. They emitted
a prodigious amount of volcanic ash and fragments of congealed
lava. For example, adjacent to one vent a mile in
diameter, about 4 miles north-northeast of Jackson Lake
Lodge, is a continuous section, 7,000 feet thick, of waterlaid
strata derived in large part from this volcanic source.
These sedimentary rocks comprise the Colter Formation
which is darker colored and contains more iron and magnesium
than the Wiggins Formation. The site of deposition
at this locality was a north-trending trough that represented
an early stage in the downwarping of Jackson Hole.</p>
<p>Pliocene volcanoes erupted in southern and central
Yellowstone Park. The volcanoes emitted viscous,
frothy, pinkish-gray and brown lava called <i>rhyolite</i>. This
is an extrusive igneous rock that has the same composition
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
as granite, but is much finer grained. In several places,
lava apparently flowed into the north end of Teewinot
Lake, chilled suddenly, and solidified into a black volcanic
glass called <i>obsidian</i>. Because it chips easily into
thin flakes having a smooth surface, obsidian was prized
by the Indians, who used it for spear and arrow points
(<a href="#fig54">fig. 54</a>). Some of this obsidian has a potassium-argon
date of 9 million years.</p>

</div>
<p>After Teewinot Lake was filled with sediment, the
floor of Jackson Hole became a flat boulder-covered surface.
Nearby vents erupted heavy fiery clouds of gaseous
molten rock that rolled across this plain and then congealed
into hard layers with the general appearance of lava flows.
Under a microscope, however, the rock is seen to be made
up of compressed fragments of glass that matted down and
solidified when the clouds stopped moving. This kind of
rock is called a <i>welded tuff</i>. One of these forms the conspicuous
ledge in the Bivouac Formation on the north and
east sides of Signal Mountain (<a href="#fig55">fig. 55</a>), and is especially
important because it has a potassium-argon date of 2.5
million years. More of this <i>welded tuff</i> flowed southward
from Yellowstone National Park, engulfed the north end
of the Teton Range (<a href="#fig53">fig. 53</a>), and continued southward
along the west side of the mountains for 35 miles and along
the east side for 25 miles.</p>

<h2 id="c51"><br /><span class="small">QUATERNARY&mdash;TIME OF ICE, MORE LAKES, AND CONTINUED CRUSTAL DISTURBANCE</span></h2>
<p>The Quaternary Period is represented by less than 15-thousandths
of the last inch on our yardstick of time (<a href="#fig56">fig. 56</a>)
and the entire Ice Age takes up less than 2-thousandths
of an inch (less than the thickness of this page). Nevertheless,
the spectacular effects of various forces of nature on
the Teton landscape during this short interval of time are of
such significance that they warrant a separate discussion.
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
The role of glaciers in carving the rugged Teton peaks and
shaping the adjacent valleys was mentioned in the first part
of this booklet, but is discussed in more detail here. The
magnitude and complexity of crustal movements increased
during the final 2 million years of time&mdash;so much so that
the beginning of Quaternary time has not yet been identified
with any single event. <a href="#fig56">Figure 56</a> shows the major
events described below.</p>
<h3 id="c52">Hoback normal fault</h3>
<p>The <i>Hoback normal fault</i>, 30 miles long, with a mile
or more displacement, developed in the southernmost part
of Jackson Hole about 2 million years ago. This fault is on
the east side of the valley. Thus, the valley block was downdropped
between this fault and the Teton fault that borders
the west side.</p>
<h3 id="c53">Volcanic activity</h3>
<p>During or shortly after major movement on the Hoback
fault, and perhaps related to it, there was a complex
series of volcanic eruptions west and north of the town of
Jackson, along the south boundary of the park. In rapid
succession, lavas of many types, with a combined thickness
of more than 1,000 feet, were extruded and volcanic plugs
intruded into the near-surface sedimentary rocks. These
volcanic rocks can be seen on the East and West Gros
Ventre Buttes.</p>
<p>There are no active volcanoes in the Teton region today
and no postglacial lava flows or cinder cones. Five miles
north of Grand Teton National Park are boiling springs
(Flagg Ranch hot springs) that are associated with the
youngest (late Quaternary) lavas in southern Yellowstone
Park. Elsewhere in Jackson Hole are a number of lukewarm
springs but their relation to volcanic rocks has not
been determined.</p>
<p>What happened to the vast thicknesses of volcanic debris?
We know they existed because sections of them have
been measured on the eroded edges of uptilted folds and
fault blocks. Many cubic miles of these rocks are now
buried beneath the floor of Jackson Hole, but a much greater
volume was carried completely out of the region by water,
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
ice, and wind during the final chapter of geologic
history.</p>
<h3 id="c54">Preglacial lakes</h3>
<p>Remnants of two sets of lake deposits in Jackson Hole
record preglacial events in Quaternary time. Downdropping
of southern Jackson Hole along the Hoback and Teton
faults blocked the southwestward drainage of the Snake
River, and a new lake formed overlapping and extending
south of the site of the long-vanished Teewinot Lake. Incorporated
in the lake sediments are fragments of lava like
that in nearby Quaternary flows. From this we know that
the lake formed after at least some of the lava was emplaced.
Apparently subsidence was more rapid than filling,
for a time, at least, because this new lake was deep.
Fossil snails preserved in olive-drab to gray fine-grained
claystone overlying lava flows at the north end of East Gros
Ventre Butte are the kind now living at depths of 120 to 300
feet in Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada. Near the margins
of the lake, pink and green claystone and soft sandstone
were deposited. The duration of this lake is not known but
it lasted long enough for 200 feet of beds to accumulate.
Subsequent faulting and warping destroyed the lake, left
tilted remnants of the beds perched 1,000 feet up on the
east side of Jackson Hole, and permitted the Snake River to
reestablish its course across the mountains to the southwest.</p>
<p>Later downdropping of Jackson Hole impounded a
second preglacial lake. Little is known about its extent because
nearly everywhere the soft brown and gray shale,
claystone, and sandstone deposited in it were scooped out
and washed away during subsequent glaciations. A few
remnants of the lake deposits are preserved in protected
places, however; two are within the Gros Ventre River Valley&mdash;one
downstream from Lower Slide Lake about a mile
east of the park and the other 4 miles farther east. The latter
remnant is nearly 500 feet thick and the upper half is
largely very fine grained shale and claystone. This fine
texture suggests that the lake existed for a good many thousand
years, for such deposits commonly accumulate more
slowly than coarser grained debris.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c55">The Ice Age</h3>
<p>With the uplift of the Teton Range and the formation
of Jackson Hole late in Cenozoic time the landscape gradually
began to assume the general outlines that we see today.
Rain, wind, snow, and frost shaped the first crude
approximations of the present ridges and peaks. Streams
cut into the rising Teton fault block, eroding the ancestral
canyons deeper and deeper as the uplift continued. The
most recent great chapter in the story of the Teton landscape,
however, remained to be written by the glaciers of
the <i>Ice Age</i>.</p>
<p>The reasons for the climatic changes that caused the
Ice Age are still a matter of much scientific debate. Various
theories have been advanced that attribute them to changes
in solar radiation, changes in the earth&rsquo;s orbit and inclination
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
to the sun, variations in the amount of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere, shifts in the positions of the continents
or the poles, and to many other factors, but none has met
with universal acceptance. No doubt the explanation lies in
some unusual combination of circumstances, for widespread
glaciation occurred only twice before in the earth&rsquo;s
history&mdash;once in the late Precambrian and once during the
Permian. It is quite clear, however, that the glaciers did
not form in response to any local cause such as the uplift of
the Teton Range, for concurrent climatic changes and ice
advance took place throughout many parts of the world.</p>
<p>At least three times in the last 250,000 years glaciers
from the surrounding highlands invaded Jackson Hole. The
oldest and most widespread glaciation probably took place
about 200,000 years ago; it was called the <i>Buffalo Glaciation</i>
by Prof. Eliot Blackwelder in 1915 (see selected
references). The age estimate is based on measurements
of the thickness of the decomposed layer on the surface of
obsidian pebbles in the glacial debris. Major sources of ice
were the Beartooth Mountains (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>), the Absaroka
Range, and the Wind River Range. The Gros Ventre Mountains
and Teton Range furnished lesser amounts of ice.</p>
<p>The ice from the Beartooth and Absaroka centers of
ice accumulation converged in the northeastern part of
Grand Teton National Park and flowed south along the face
of the Teton Range in a giant stream that in many places
was 2,000 feet thick (<a href="#fig57">fig. 57</a>). All but the highest parts
of the Pinyon Peak and Mount Leidy Highlands were
buried and scoured. Signal Mountain, Blacktail Butte, and
the Gros Ventres Buttes were overridden and shaped by ice
at this time. Another glacier, this one from the Wind River
Range, flowed northwest along the Continental Divide, then
down the Gros Ventre River Valley, and merged with the
southward-moving main ice stream west of Lower Slide
Lake. Where Jackson Hole narrows southward, the glacier
became more and more confined, but nevertheless flowed
all the way through the Snake River Canyon and on into
Idaho.</p>

</div>
<p>The volume of this great ice mass was probably considerably
more than 1,000 cubic miles. When it melted,
nearly all the previously accumulated soil in Jackson Hole
was washed away and a pavement of quartzite boulders
mantled much of the glaciated surface. In areas not subsequently
glaciated, the lack of soil and abundance of quartzite
boulders drastically influenced the topography, later
drainage, distribution of all types of vegetation, especially
conifers and grass, and the pattern of human settlement and
industry.</p>

</div>
<p>The second glaciation, named <i>Bull Lake</i>, was less
than half as extensive as the first. A large tongue of ice
from the Absaroka center of accumulation flowed down the
Buffalo River Valley and joined ice from the Tetons on the
floor of Jackson Hole. An enormous outwash fan of quartzite
boulders extended from near Blacktail Butte southward
throughout most of southern Jackson Hole. Glaciers in the
Gros Ventre Mountains did not advance beyond the east
margin of the valley floor. Carbon-14 ages and data from
weathered obsidian pebbles suggest that this glaciation took
place between 35,000 and 80,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Bull Lake moraines and outwash deposits are overlain
directly in the southern part of Jackson Hole by fine
silt, rather than by deposits of the third glaciation (<a href="#fig58">fig. 58</a>).
This silt, of windblown origin, is called <i>loess</i> and contains
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
fossil shells dated by Carbon-14 as between 13,000 and
19,000 years old. Wherever the loess occurs, it is marked
by abundant modern coyote dens and badger burrows.</p>

</div>
<p>The third and last glaciation, named the <i>Pinedale</i>,
was even less extensive than the others. Nevertheless it was
of great importance for it added the final touches to the
present landscape. The jagged intricately ice-carved peaks
(<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>) and the glittering lakes and broad gravelly plains
are vivid reminders of this recent chapter in geologic
history.</p>
<p>Pinedale glaciers advanced down Cascade, Garnet,
Avalanche, and Death Canyons and spilled out onto the
floor of Jackson Hole, where they built the outermost loops
of the conspicuous terminal moraines that now encircle
Jenny, Bradley, Taggart, and Phelps Lakes (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>). Ice
streams from Glacier Gulch and Open Canyon also left
prominent moraines on the valley floor, but these do not
contain lakes. Ice from Leigh Canyon and all of the eastward-draining
valleys to the north combined to form a
large glacier in roughly the present position of Jackson
Lake. This ice entirely surrounded Signal Mountain, leaving
only the upper few hundred feet projecting as an island
or <i>nunatak</i>.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>The southernmost major advance of Pinedale ice from
Jackson Lake is marked by a series of densely timbered
moraines that cross the Snake River Valley. This series is
collectively named the <i>Burned Ridge moraine</i> (<a href="#fig61">fig. 61</a>).
Extending southward for 10 miles from this moraine is a
remarkably flat surfaced gravelly outwash deposit. It was
spread by streams that poured from the glacier at the time
the moraine was being built (<a href="#fig59">fig. 59</a>). East of the Snake
River, the main highway from a point just north of Blacktail
Butte to the Snake River overlook is built on this flat
untimbered surface. We assume that the outwash is younger
than 15,000 years because it apparently overlies loess of
that age.</p>
<p>The glacier withdrew rapidly northward from the
Burned Ridge moraine, leaving behind many large irregular
masses of stagnant, debris-covered ice. The sites of
these became kettles, locally known as &ldquo;The Potholes&rdquo; (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>).
The main glacier retreated to a position marked by
the loop of moraines just south of Jackson Lake (<a href="#fig60">fig. 60</a>).
<a href="#fig61">Figure 61</a> is a sketch map showing how the glaciers in this
part of Jackson Hole might have appeared at the time the
Jackson Lake moraine was built.</p>
<p>Abundant snail shells have been found in lake sediments
in the bottoms of the kettles north of the Burned
Ridge moraine (<a href="#fig60">fig. 60</a>) as well as on low ridges between
them. Carbon-14 age determinations indicate that the snails
lived about 9,000 years ago, either in a lake already present
before the Pinedale ice advanced and formed the
Burned Ridge moraine or in ponds that filled kettles left as
the ice melted behind this moraine.</p>
<p>In either case, the shells indicate that the Pinedale
glaciers probably existed on the floor of Jackson Hole as
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
recently as 9,000 years ago, at a time when Indians were
already living in the area. We can easily imagine the fascination
with which these primitive peoples may have
watched as year after year the glaciers wasted away, slowly
retreating back into the canyons, then withdrawing into the
sheltered recesses of the high mountains, eventually to
dwindle and disappear.</p>
<p>Many bits of evidence, both from North America and
Europe, indicate that there was a period called the <i>climatic
optimum</i> about 6,000 years ago when the climate was
significantly warmer and drier than at present. We suspect,
though there is as yet no direct proof, that the Pinedale
glaciers wasted away entirely during this interval.</p>
<p>The modern pattern of vegetation in Jackson Hole is
strongly influenced by the distribution of Pinedale glacial
moraines and outwash deposits. Almost without exception
the moraines are heavily forested, whereas the nearby outwash
deposits are covered only by a sparse growth of sagebrush.
This is probably because the moraines contain large
amounts of clay and silt produced by the grinding action
of the glaciers. Material of this type retains water much
better and, because of the greater variety of chemical elements,
is more fertile than the porous quartzite gravel and
sand on the outwash plains.</p>
<h3 id="c56">Modern glaciers</h3>
<p>About a dozen small rapidly dwindling glaciers exist
today in shaded reentrants high in the Teton Range. They
are probably vestiges of ice masses built up since the climatic
optimum, during the so-called &ldquo;<i>Little Ice Age</i>.&rdquo;
These glaciers, while insignificant compared to those still
present in many other mountain ranges, are fascinating
working models of the great ice streams that shaped the
Tetons during Pleistocene time.</p>
<p>The Teton Glacier (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) is one of the best known.
It is an ice body about 3,500 feet long and 1,100 feet wide
that lies at the head of Glacier Gulch, shaded by the encircling
ridges of the Grand Teton, Mount Owen, and
Mount Teewinot. Ice in the central part is moving at a rate
of more than 30 feet a year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<h2 id="c57"><br /><span class="small">THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE</span></h2>
<p>The geologic story of the Teton country from the time
the earth was new to the present day has been summarized.
What can we learn from it? We become aware that events
recorded in the rocks are not a chaotic jumble of random
accidents but came in an orderly, logical succession. We
see the majestic parade of life evolving from simple to complex
types, overcoming all natural disasters, and adapting
to ever-changing environments. We can only speculate as
to the motivating force that launched this fascinating geologic
and biologic venture and what the ultimate goal may
be. New facts and new ideas are added to the story each
year, but many unknown chapters remain to be studied;
these offer an irresistible, continuing challenge to inquisitive
minds, strong bodies, and restless, adventurous spirits.</p>
<p>Most geologic processes that developed the Teton
landscape have been beneficial to man; a few have interfered
with his activities, cost him money, time, effort, and
on occasion, his life. Postglacial faulting and tilting
along the southern margin of Grand Teton National Park
diverted drainage systems (such as Flat Creek, southwest
of the Flat Creek fault on the south edge of the <a href="#fig62">geologic map</a>),
raised hills, dropped valleys, and made steep slopes
unstable. Flood-control engineers wage a never-ending
struggle to keep the Snake River from shifting to the west
side of Jackson Hole as the valley tilts westward in response
to movement along the Teton fault. Each highway
into Jackson Hole has been blocked by a landslide at one
time or another and maintenance of roads across slide areas
requires much ingenuity. We see one slide (the Gros Ventre)
that blocked a river; larger slides have occurred in the
past, and more can be expected. Abundant fresh fault
scarps are a constant reminder that public buildings, campgrounds,
dams, and roads need to be designed to withstand
the effects of earthquakes. Some of these problems have
geologic solutions; others can be avoided or minimized as
further study increases our understanding of this region.</p>

<p>Man appeared during the last one-fiftieth of an inch
on our yardstick of time gone by. In this short span he has
had more impact on the earth and its inhabitants than any
other form of life. Will he use wisely the lessons of the
past as a guide while he writes his record on the yardstick
of the future?</p>

<h3 id="c61">About the authors</h3>
<p>J. D. Love, a native of Wyoming, received his bachelor
and master of arts degrees from the University of Wyoming
and his doctor of philosophy degree from Yale University.
His first field season in the Teton country, in 1933, was
financed by the Geological Survey of Wyoming. After 12
years of geologic work ranging from New England to Utah
and Michigan to Mississippi, he returned to the Teton region.
Beginning in 1945, he spent parts or all of 20 field
seasons in and near the Tetons. He compiled the first geologic
map of Teton County. He is the senior author of the
geologic map of Wyoming, and author or co-author of more
than 70 other published maps and papers on the geology of
Wyoming. In 1961, the University of Wyoming awarded
him an honorary doctor of laws degree for his work on
uranium deposits that &ldquo;led to the development of the uranium
industry in Wyoming.&rdquo; The Wyoming Geological Association
made him an honorary life member and gave him a
special award for his geologic studies of the Teton area. He
is a Fellow of the Geological Society of America and is
active in various other geological organizations, as well as
having been president of the Wyoming Chapters of Sigma
Xi (scientific honorary) and Phi Beta Kappa (scholastic
honorary) societies.</p>
<p>John C. Reed, Jr., joined the U.S. Geological Survey in
1953 after receiving his doctor of philosophy degree from
the John Hopkins University. His principal geologic work
before coming to the Teton region was in Alaska and in the
southern Appalachians. Beginning in 1961, he spent five
field seasons studying and mapping the Precambrian
rocks in Grand Teton National Park, including all the high
peaks in the Teton Range. He is a noted mountaineer, a Fellow
of the Geological Society of America, a member of the
Arctic Institute of North America, and the American Alpine
Club. His numerous publications, in addition to those on
the Tetons, describe the geology of mountainous areas in
Alaska, the Appalachians, and Utah.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
